Title: Elastic Stack (ELK Stack)

---

Chapter: Debian Elastic Stack Installation, Configuration, and Cyber Security Architecture

The ELK Stack was officially rebranded as the Elastic Stack following the introduction of Beats, a family of lightweight data shippers, as the fourth core component. While it is still widely referred to as the ELK Stack within the community, the vendor Elastic positions the entire ecosystem under this unified name.

Recently, critical developments have occurred in the Elastic Stack ecosystem, fundamentally reshaping its architecture, licensing, and usage patterns. In this guide, we will perform a clean, step-by-step installation of the Elastic Stack on Debian/Ubuntu, and analyze these next-generation evolutions (return to open source via AGPLv3, Elastic Agent & Fleet architecture, ES|QL query language, and Generative AI integration) from a system and security perspective.

Section: What is Elastic Stack?

The Elastic Stack is the industry standard platform for log management, infrastructure observability, and security operations (SIEM/XDR). While traditionally composed of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, it now encompasses the Beats family, the unified Elastic Agent architecture, and the Fleet central management system.

Elastic Stack Components

Elasticsearch: A distributed search and analytics engine used to store, index, and query large volumes of structured and unstructured data in milliseconds, now equipped with vector database capabilities.
Logstash: A server-side data processing pipeline tool that manages ingestion, parsing with Grok filters, and data transformation.
Kibana: A web UI used to visualize Elasticsearch data, manage Fleet policies, and configure SIEM detection rules.
Beats: Lightweight data shippers installed on edge servers to collect logs (Filebeat), system metrics (Metricbeat), network traffic (Packetbeat), and more.
Elastic Agent & Fleet: A modern endpoint architecture that consolidates all Beats shippers into a single agent, managed centrally via Kibana's Fleet console.

Traditional installation order of Elastic Stack products:
1- Elasticsearch
2- Kibana
3- Logstash

Chapter: Recent Evolutions and Architectural Shifts in the Elastic Stack

Several major changes have recently transformed the Elastic Stack ecosystem:

<div class="render-cards">
<div class="render-card render-card-csr">
<span class="render-badge">LICENSING</span>
<h3>License Wars & AGPLv3</h3>
<p>To prevent cloud providers from commercializing its code without contributing, Elastic replaced Apache 2.0 with the SSPL model in 2021. Recently, Elastic introduced the <strong>AGPLv3</strong> license choice alongside SSPL and Elastic License 2.0, officially restoring its <strong>"Open Source"</strong> status. Meanwhile, AWS's fork, <strong>OpenSearch</strong>, continues to thrive as an independent ecosystem.</p>

<span class="render-badge">ARCHITECTURE</span>
<h3>Elastic Agent & Fleet</h3>
<p>Instead of managing fragmented Beats (Filebeat, Metricbeat, etc.) configuration files across servers, the unified <strong>Elastic Agent</strong> is deployed. Via Kibana <strong>Fleet</strong>, admins can centrally update agents and assign policies, shifting parsing tasks from Logstash to Elasticsearch Ingest Nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="render-card render-card-ssg">
<span class="render-badge">ES|QL</span>
<h3>ES|QL Query Language</h3>
<p>Alongside KQL and Lucene, Elastic introduced <strong>ES|QL</strong>, a pipe-based (<code>|</code>) SQL-like query language. Built on a brand-new, optimized execution engine, it enables developers to filter, transform, and aggregate data directly within Elasticsearch, dramatically accelerating threat-hunting queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="render-card render-card-isr">
<span class="render-badge">AI / VECTOR</span>
<h3>AI & Vector Database</h3>
<p>Elasticsearch now functions as a Vector Database, integrating with NLP models and Elastic's proprietary <strong>ELSER</strong> search model. This enables semantic search on log repositories, allowing security analysts to query abstract concepts like "unusual user actions" with high contextual accuracy.</p>

First, we need to prepare the environment in which we will install. For this we need to have an operating system.

Section: What is Debian?

Debian was started in 1993 and was prepared by volunteers in various parts of the world; GNU/Hurd is a completely free Linux distribution based on different kernel options like GNU/Linux. Some popular debian based linux distributions:

Ubuntu.
PureOS.
antix.
Deep.
PopOS!
MX Linux.
Linux Mint.
Kali Linux.
Pardus.

We have listed some members of the Debian family here. Apart from this, you can also install the ELK stack on Windows, Macos or Redhat based or other independent Linux distributions. In this article, I will install on an ubuntu machine. However, the same installation steps are valid for other Debian-based distributions.

Section: Preliminary Preparation

First, let's look at the information of the system we will install and make sure that the distribution is the latest version for security reasons.

[Image: No image description]

Version information of the Ubuntu distribution I installed.

I named my current server "elastic" as the hostname and created an authorized user named "superman".

Then let's make updates to our system. Performing these updates before each installation allows us to minimize possible errors caused by dependencies.

> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

[Image: No image description]

Package updates

Finally, we need to make sure that our machine has enough resources. So it must have enough disk, ram and CPU. This will vary depending on your needs.

Section: Elasticsearch Installation

To install Elasticsearch, we first need to download the Debian package.

[Image: No image description]

Downloading process of elasticsearch debian package with wget

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

We can download using the wget tool.

Then, let's perform the installation process with dpkg, which is the package installation tool of Debian. We need root authority for installation.

[Image: No image description]

Elasticsearch installation

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

At the end of the installation, it offers us suggestions on how to continue the installation.

[Image: No image description]

Post-installation steps

From here, let's continue with the post-installation steps. First, let's start our service.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

We can obtain information about the status of the service by using the journalctl command.

[Image: No image description]

Service status review with journalctl

Now, the password of the user "elastic", which is the default authorized user that allows us to access the elasticsearch interface, is set.Let's reset it. Here we can give the password we want.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

elastic user password reset

Now it is time to generate the token that we will use in the Kibana connection.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

Generating tokens for kibana connection

We must store this token carefully. We will use it to connect to Kibana in the future.

Finally, we need to open the elasticsearch port on our system's firewall.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

Firewall port opening process

Now our system broadcasts the elasticsearch service to the network it is located on. We can access it via browser.

> https://<host-ip>:9200

[Image: No image description]

Access via browser

Here, you can access elasticsearch by entering elastic as the username and the password you determined in the previous steps as the password.

Section: Kibana Installation

To install Kibana, we first need to download the Debian package.

[Image: No image description]

Downloading process of elasticsearch debian package with wget

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

We can download using the wget tool.

Then, let's perform the installation process with dpkg, which is the package installation tool of Debian. We need root authority for installation.

[Image: No image description]

Kibana installation

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

After the installation is completed, we can start kibana configurations. To do this, we open Kibana's configuration file with nano.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

kibana.yml file

Here I will only show the areas that need to be changed.

[Image: No image description]

server.port

Delete the # sign in front of the server.port field and write the port you want the Kibana service to run on in quotes. By default it is 5601.

[Image: No image description]

server.host

Delete the # sign in front of the server.host field and write the IP address of your own system in quotes.

[Image: No image description]

server.name

Delete the # sign in front of the server.name field and write your own system's hostname in quotes. I wrote it because mine was "elastic".

[Image: No image description]

elasticsearch.hosts

The elasticsearch service that kibana will connect to. Since I installed this service on the same machine, localhost can remain. If it was a different host, I would have to write its IP. Also, let's not forget to change the initial protocol to "https".

[Image: No image description]

elasticsearch token link

kibana offers 2 ways to authenticate the elasticsearch connection. One of these is verification with username and password, and the other is verification with the token we will use. If you remember, we created a token during the elasticsearch installation. We enter this token between quotation marks.

[Image: No image description]

ssl.verification

Since the certificate used by elasticsearch is self-signed, it has not been verified by any authority. This causes us to receive an SSL verification error when connecting to Kibana. To avoid this error, we set the ssl.verification field to "none". Or you can install a verified ssl certificate.

That's basically all we need to configure. You can review Kibana's documentation to set other fields. I'm sticking with the default configurations for the rest.

Now let's start our service.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

We can obtain information about the status of the service by using the journalctl command.

[Image: No image description]

kibana service startthrowing away

Finally, we open the 5601 port used by Kibana through the system firewall.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

Port Opening Process

You can now access the kibana panel via your browser.

> https://<host-ip>:5601/

It may take a while for Kibana to stand up.

[Image: No image description]

kibana panel

Our Kibana panel has appeared. You can log in to this panel with the "elastic" user. Let's continue the installations.

Section: Logstash Installation

To install Logstash, we first need to download the Debian package.

[Image: No image description]

Downloading logstash package with wget

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

logstash installation process

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

After the installation is completed, we can start configurations.

First, let's give the password to the logstash\_system user for the elasticsearch connection. don't forget this password

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

logstash\_system user password setting

Then let's open the logstashin configuration file and edit it.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

logstash.yml file

Do not forget to enclose the string values we provide in this file in quotes.

Now we can start the logstash service.

[Image: No image description]

starting logstash service

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

Finally, we open the 5044 port, which is the default port of logstashin, in our system.

[Image: No image description]

Port opening process

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

We cannot access Logstashe through a browser like elasticsearch or kibana. Because logstash receives and queues logs from port 5044. So it doesn't give any answer.

Let's configure our first pipeline!

[Image: No image description]

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

Ready for input

Our pipeline is listening and ready for logs coming to port 5044.

You can parse your logs by writing various parsers with logstash.

In this article, I mentioned the ELK stack installation. In my next article, I will talk about sending logs to ELK, agent installation and log parceling. You can follow me to be informed about the articles I publish.

Chapter: ELK Stack Log Management and Analysis

Hello, in this article, I will talk about the log management of ELK Stack, which we installed in my last article, namely log collection, parsing and enrichment processes. How to Collect, Process and Send Logs with Logstash?

Section: What is Log Management?

Log management is the process of collecting, storing, analyzing and managing all log records (logs) produced by a system or application. These logs contain important information about the operation of the system and are used in many areas such as troubleshooting, security analysis, and performance monitoring.

Log collection methods with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):

Syslog: With this protocol, which is common in UNIX-based systems, logs can be collected via Logstash or Beats.
Beats: Provides different tools for log collection. Metricbeat collects performance metrics, while Winlogbeat collects Windows events. Heartbeat monitors the status of the servers. .Filebeat collects log files from file systems and sends this data to Logstash or Elasticsearch. Each requires separate installation.
Agent Installation: Agents are installed on systems that are log sources (servers, network devices, etc.) and these agents send data to Logstash or Beats.

Agent Installation Advantages:

Central Management: Provides a central point to collect and manage log data. This makes it easier to store and analyze log data in an organized manner.
Real-Time Monitoring: Agents can monitor events in real-time and provide instant reporting. This allows detecting anomalies quickly.
Customizability: Agents can be configured according to specific requirements. You can apply various rules and filters to collect and transform log data from different sources.
Enhanced Security: Agents support encryption protocols to ensure secure transmission of log data.
Performance Monitoring: Agents can be used to monitor system performance and detect performance issues.

Agent Installation Disadvantages:

Resource Usage: Agents may consume resources on the systems where they are installed. This can cause performance issues, especially in high-density systems.
Management Complexity: Managing multiple agents can be complex, especially in large-scale systems. Updating and managing each agent can be time-consuming.
Security Risks: Misconfigured agents can cause security vulnerabilities. Therefore, it is important to configure and manage agents securely.
Compatibility Issues: Compatibility issues may occur between different systems and platforms. Some agents may not have full functionality on certain systems.

In this article, we will send logs with beats and collect logs with logstash from a Linux system.

Section: Logstash Configuration

Logstash is easier to understand when you imagine it as a pipeline. At one end of this pipeline are inputs that represent data sources. As log records pass through the Logstash pipeline, they can be enriched, filtered or manipulated based on your needs. Ultimately, when they reach the end of the pipeline, Logstash can deliver these logs to configured destinations for storage or analysis.

[Image: No image description]

Logstash Pipeline

To create this data processing pipeline, you can configure Logstash using a configuration file. A typical logstash configuration file:

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

Now let's examine these components:

input: represents log sources such as files or endpoints.
filter(optional): merges and transforms log records.
output: destination to which the processed logs will be delivered.

These inputs, filters, and outputs need plug-ins to fulfill their roles. These plugins are the building blocks that power Logstash and enable it to perform a wide variety of tasks. Let's review these plugins to give you a better understanding of Logstash's capabilities.

Section: Logstash input plugins

Logstash for inputs,Provides input plugins(https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/input-plugins.html) that can collect logs from various sources such as:

HTTP: Retrieves logs via HTTP endpoints.
Beats: Collects logs from the Beats framework.
Redis: collects log records from a Redis instance.
Unix: read logs through a Unix socket.

Section: Logstash filter plugins

When you want to manipulate, enrich or replace logs, some of the filter plugins here can help you do so:

JSON: Parses JSON logs.
Grok: parses and structures log data.
I18n: removes special characters from your log records.
Geoip: adds geographic information.

Section: Logstash output plugins

After processing the data, the following output plugins may be useful:

WebSocket: forward logs to a WebSocket endpoint.
S3: send log records to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).
Syslog: forward logs to a Syslog server.
Elasticsearch: pass log entries to Elasticsearch, which is part of the Elastic stack.

To set up the logstash pipeline, create a configuration file in the etc/logstash/conf.d directory.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

We will transfer logs with beats. Our configuration file for this is:

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

In this file, you need to write the password of your own "elastic" user in the password field.

I used the grok plugin as a filter on Logstash. grok is a very good parser plugin. We will be parsing our incoming logs on Logstash with the grok plugin.

Now change ownership of directory /usr/share/logstash/data to user logstash:

Changing ownership of Logstash data directory

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

Now start Logstash by passing the path to the configuration file:

Logstash Service Status

Now our pipilen is ready. Our service is up and running. We can move on to the next step.

Section: Beats Configuration

We will use the beats tool to send logs via clients to our Logstash service running on our ELK server. By installing beats on client systems, we can send logs from the systems.

Each Beat is a separately installable product:

Auditbeat.
Filebeat.
Heartbeat.
Metricbeat.
Packetbeat.
Winlogbeat.

As you can see, there are many beat products. Let's use the filebeat product to send the log files in our system.

We start the installation on our client system. I will continue with my same system. The server on which I installed my ELK system will also be my client.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

Filebeat installation

After downloading and installing Filebeat, we proceed to the configuration process.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

Elasticsearch Output

Since we will direct our output to logstashe, we close the elasticsearch section with a square sign.

[Image: No image description]

Logstash Output

In the Logstash section, we enter the IP and port number of our Logstash server.

[Image: No image description]

Log Collection Configuration

In the Paths section, we can configure the logs that our beat will collect. By default, it collects log files under the /var/log/ directory. For more, we can add the logs of important services (WEB, DNS, DHCP, etc.) running on our server to this section.

When our configuration settings are completed, we can save the file and exit.

Now it's time to start our filebeat.

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

[Image: No image description]

Filebeat Service Status

We have now completed our filebeat configuration and started our service. Our service is up and running.

You can install and configure other beats products in a similar way.

Section: Kibana Configuration

We have completed our Logstash and Filebeat installations. Now let's open our kibana interface. Then let's enter the elasticsearch section. Let's check if our index has arrived in the Indicies area.

[Image: No image description]

Kibana Interface

We can see our incoming index in this interface. Now let's go to the "Discover" section.

[Image: No image description]

Discover Panel

We will create a new data view by clicking the Create Data View button.

[Image: No image description]

Creating a Data View

Give it a name and select the index pattern, you may want to name it filebeat\ as you want the filebeat directory despite the time it was created, if you select filebat-test-2023.10.03\ only one directory will be loaded and the new directory will not be able to receive real time data as it will be under different data. Therefore, you should avoid it.

After saving the Data View, logs should appear in the discover panel. If it hasn't arrived, there is a problem.

[Image: No image description]

Discover Panel

We can now perform log search from this panel.

In this article, we added a log source to our ELK system. We parsed the logs and sent them to elasticsearch. We made the necessary configurations in the Kibana interface.

Chapter: ELK Stack Rule Writing and Alerting

Hello, in this article, I will talk about rule writing, that is, warnings indicating security violations, and alerting operations of ELK Stack, which we installed in my last article. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) facilitates rule writing and alerting operations, data analysis and management.

Section: What are IoC and IoA ?

IoC (Indicators of Compromise) and IoA (Indicators of Attack) are important concepts in the field of cyber security and are used in the detection and analysis of attacks.

These markers are critical in detecting and stopping an attack. While IoC detects that an attack has occurred, IoA helps understand the methods and objectives of the attack.

Section: Indicators of Compromise (IoC)

IoC are indicators that indicate the presence of malicious activities or attacks on a system. These markers help detect that an attack or breach has occurred. Examples of IoC may include:

Malware Signatures: Signatures of known malware.
IP Addresses: IP addresses linked to malicious activity.
Domain Addresses: Domain names associated with malicious activities.
File Hash Values: Hash values of malicious files.

Section: Indicators of Attack (IoA)

IoA are indicators that indicate that an attack is being carried out or is in the process of occurring. IoA helps understand the methodology of the attack and the attacker's objectives from a broader perspective. Examples of IoA may include:

Strange User Behavior: User behavior that differs from normal, such as unauthorized data access attempts.
System Changes: Unexpected system configuration changes.
Command and Control Traffic: Attacker's attempts to communicate with the system remotely.
File System Changes: Unexpected file additions or deletions.
Exploiting Software Vulnerabilities: Attempts to exploit known software vulnerabilities.

Section: Elastalert

Elastalert allows you to create alerts when certain conditions occur in Elasticsearch. Elastalert can be configured with specific filters and conditions, and alerts can be notified across various channels such as email, webhook, Slack. see: <https://elastalert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/elastalert.html>

[Image: No image description]

ELK Stack

ElastAlert is a simple framework for alerting about anomalies, spikes, or other interesting patterns from data in Elasticsearch.

If you are writing data to Elasticsearch in real time and want to receive alerts when this data matches certain patterns, ElastAlert is the tool for you.

Kibana provides an easy interface to create and manage alerts in Elasticsearch. In Kibana, you can create new alerts and manage existing alerts in the alerts and actions section.

Section: Alerting

Alerts mean being notified automatically when certain conditions or anomalies are detected. Alerts in Elasticsearch optimize data analysis and management processes.

Rule writing ensures that certain actions are taken when certain conditions are met. APIs and tools used for rule writing in Elasticsearch include Elastalert and Kibana.

Section: Kibana Warnings

You can follow the steps below to create and manage alerts in Kibana:

Login to Kibana: Log in to Kibana and go to the administration section.
Go to Alerts and Actions Section: You can create new alerts in the Alerts and actions section.
Configure Alert: Configure the alert with specific filters and conditions.
Link Actions: Link alerts to various channels such as email, webhook, Slack.

For example, we activated the CPU usage rule. If the CPU Usage rate on the machine exceeds 10%, a warning will be generated.

You can write all kinds of rules through this menu.

Section: The Changing Face of Threat-Oriented Defense Strategy

In the field of cyber security, threat-informed defense strategy replaces traditional signature-based detection methods.It has become increasingly important in a period when it remains sweatless. While traditional approaches focus on known malware types, modern attackers are constantly changing their tactics and techniques, trying to bypass defenses. At this point, the MITER ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) framework has become a transformative resource for the cybersecurity world.

MITER ATT&CK is a globally accepted knowledge base that structures the lifecycle of an attack into tactics (the attacker's goals) and techniques (the methods he uses to achieve those goals). This framework enables the creation of a more resilient defense mechanism by focusing on the behavioral patterns of attackers rather than the tools they use. Rather than blocking a specific software used by an attacker, targeting the behavior of that software at stages such as Discovery, Execution or Privilege Escalation makes defense strategies more comprehensive and flexible. This approach allows security teams to understand attacks in a more holistic context, conduct threat hunting, and respond to incidents more effectively. Additionally, ATT&CK has become a critical tool for assessing security maturity by creating a common language about threats among different stakeholders, such as the security operations center (SOC), threat intelligence, and executives.

Section: ELK Stack: The Open Source Heart of the Modern SOC

ELK Stack is an open source and extremely popular platform used for log management and analysis. It consists of three main components, Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana, and they work together to transform raw log data into actionable security information. As a distributed and RESTful search and analysis engine, Elasticsearch stores chunked log data as JSON documents and makes it instantly queryable. Thanks to its horizontal scalability architecture, it can easily manage high volumes of data and query load.

Logstash is at the center of the data processing pipeline, taking data from various sources (files, system logs, databases) and processing, transforming and enriching them. This process consists of three main stages: inputs, filters and outputs. Filters make data more meaningful by performing actions such as separating unstructured data into meaningful fields (using Grok patterns) and adding geolocation information based on IP addresses. Finally, Kibana is an intuitive web interface for visualizing data stored in Elasticsearch. Users can create interactive dashboards, apply filters, and search raw log data. Modern versions of Kibana also include machine learning-based anomaly detection and alerting features.

ELK Stack serves a variety of use cases such as log management, infrastructure monitoring, application troubleshooting and security analysis. However, it should be noted that this platform is not a full-fledged "out of the box" SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solution. Although ELK provides log collection, processing, storage, and query capabilities, it requires additional components or custom configurations for features such as complex event correlation, built-in alert mechanisms, and automatic incident response capabilities. Therefore, the purpose of this report is to provide a structured rule set and integration guide that uses ELK's strengths to close these gaps and make sense of threats within the MITER ATT&CK framework.

Section: Basic Configurations and Resources Required for the Ruleset

The basis of creating a MITER ATT&CK-focused rule set on an ELK infrastructure lies in collecting the correct log sources, standardizing this data and processing it efficiently. This section details these basic configurations that are essential to maximize detection capabilities.

Section: Map of Log Resource Requirements

The most important log sources required to detect an attacker's behavior vary depending on the environment in which the attack occurs. Different data sources are vital for each of the MITER ATT&CK Enterprise, Mobile and ICS domains.

Mandatory Logs for Windows Systems:

Sysmon: Sysmon (System Monitor) is a Windows system service that captures critical security events such as process creation, network connections, and file access on the system through Windows Event Logs. Especially Sysmon's Event ID 1 (Process creation) event is a much more valuable resource than Windows' default security logs for detecting techniques such as T1059 (Command and Script Interpreter) and T1087 (Account Discovery) because it provides rich data such as a process's full command line arguments, host process information, and hash values.
Windows Security Event Logs: In addition to Sysmon, Windows' built-in security logs record important events related to account management. For example, creating, deleting, or adding/removing a user account to a group provides critical data to detect behaviors that attackers use to establish persistence or escalate privilege.

Mandatory Logs for Linux Systems:

Auditd: In Linux, the auditd service is used to monitor kernel-level activities such as system calls, file accesses, and process creation. Auditd logs are an indispensable source in detecting the behavior of attackers (e.g. commands such as net.exe) after infiltrating a system. Filebeat and Auditd Manager integrations allow these logs to be easily transferred to ELK.

Network and Other Resources:

Network Flow Logs: Network traffic flow logs (e.g. NetFlow) or data collected through tools such as Packetbeat are vital to detect reconnaissance tactics such as T1046 (Network Service Discovery). These logs are used to identify abnormal connection attempts (port scanning) from one source to multiple destinations or ports.
Insight: The effectiveness of the ruleset depends not only on the availability of log sources, but also on the quality of the data collected. Just collecting logs is not enough; Logs must contain enriched information (command line arguments, user names, main processes) that clearly reveals the attacker's purpose and actions. This is a critical element to maximize detection capabilities.

Section: Data Normalization: Standardization with Elastic Common Schema (ECS)

Different platforms and devices produce log data, each in a unique format. This makes analyzing log data, correlating it, and creating threat hunting queries extremely complex. Elastic Common Schema (ECS) is an open source specification developed to solve this problem, defining a standard set of fields for use when storing event data in Elasticsearch.

ECS standardizes data by providing common field names (such as process.name, source.ip, destination.port) for different log types (e.g. Windows events, Linux processes, network traffic). This standardization facilitates data correlation between log sources and makes it possible to pull data from multiple sources with a single query. This eliminates the burden for security analysts to write separate queries for each log format and speeds up discovery processes.

A security team saves time with ECS-compliant data when hunting for threats or performing root cause analysis of an incident. The attacker can understand much more quickly how the process started in one system connects to another system over the network or which files it changes, by associating data from different log sources with a single standard query. This significantly reduces incident response teams' time to detect (MTTD) and time to respond (MTTR) to an incident.

Section: Data Processing Pipelines: Logstash and Ingest Node

Raw log data must be processed and enriched before making it suitable for detection rules. ELK Stack has two primary mechanisms for this process: Logstash filters and Elasticsearch Ingest Node pipelines. Each has its own advantages and ideal usage scenarios.

Logstash Filters: Logstash has a flexible architecture consisting of input, filter and output stages. In particular, Grok filters are very powerful at separating unstructured text-based logs into meaningful areas through predefined patterns. These filters are ideal for applying enrichment operations to logs, such as geolocation information (geoip), field transformation (mutate) or conditional processing (if). Logstash acts as a middleware in the data flow, allowing complex processing of the data before it is sent to Elasticsearch.
Elasticsearch Ingest Node Pipelines: Ingest Node runs within the Elasticsearch cluster andIt is a feature that performs simple transformations right before the data is indexed. Ingest Node, which targets lighter and simpler operations than Logstash, is especially suitable for performing basic transformations on data with processors such as grok or set. These pipelines, which can be automatically configured through integrations, can simplify the architecture in scenarios that do not require the complexity of Logstash.

Making a strategic choice between both methods is important for the performance and scalability of the infrastructure. Sources indicate that Logstash is better suited for complex data transformation, enrichment, different input sources and multiple output targets, while Ingest Node simplifies the architecture for simpler processing needs. While using Logstash may be preferable in situations with heavy log volume or a complex data processing requirement, for simpler 'Grok' or field conversion operations, Ingest Node offers the potential to simplify the architecture and reduce management burden.

Section: Rules Format and Metadata Standards

While MITER creates a rule set focused on ATT&CK, ensuring that each rule complies with a specific standard and structure increases the manageability of the rule set and its usability for the security team. This section describes the basic components of the rule structure and proper methods of association with MITER ATT&CK.

Section: Rule Configuration Methodology

Each rule should contain key components to effectively detect threats and provide actionable information to security teams. These components are:

Rule ID (rule_id): There must be a unique identifier for each rule. This identity makes it easy to track, update, and report on the rule throughout its lifecycle. For example, it is recommended to use a descriptive ID such as PS-Encoded-Cmd-Detection-001.
Severity (severity): It is a value that shows the potential impact of the event triggered by the rule. Typically, ratings such as Critical, High, Medium or Low are used. This helps security analysts determine which alarms they should prioritize.
Description (description): It is the text that clearly explains what the rule detects, why it is important and what goal the attacker is trying to achieve. A well-written description speeds up the triage phase of an incident.

Section: MITER ATT&CK Labeling

One of the most important elements of the rule set is that each rule is accurately labeled with the MITER ATT&CK tactic and technique it identifies. This tagging puts raw log data into the context of the attack, allowing security teams to more quickly understand the intent behind an incident.

When creating a rule in Kibana, it is possible to add these tags via custom fields such as mitre.tactic and mitre.technique_id. For example, the JSON output of a rule might look like this:

[Code Block: A code example is present here. Code contents are skipped in the voiceover.]

These tags act as a bridge for security analysts, allowing them to instantly understand what the attacker is trying to do (tactics) and what method (technique) they are using when they see an alarm. This information speeds up the incident response process and allows for a holistic picture of the defense strategy.

Section: Rule Examples and Identification According to MITER ATT&CK Tactics

In this section, concrete and applicable rule examples are presented for selected MITER ATT&CK techniques under Reconnaissance and Execution tactics. These examples are created based on data from different log sources and explain both the rule logic and the relevant context.

Section: Tactic: Execution — TA0002

This tactic involves attackers attempting to run their own code or commands on a system.

Section: Technical: T1059 Command and Script Interpreter

Attackers tend to execute code on the system using command and script interpreters (e.g., PowerShell, Bash, cmd.exe), which are built-in operating system tools. This technique is one of the most frequently used methods in attack campaigns. PowerShell is frequently abused, especially to bypass defense mechanisms, run malicious payloads in memory, and obfuscate complex commands.

Rule Example 1: Suspicious PowerShell Commands Detected (T1059.001)

This rule detects when PowerShell is run with the --EncodedCommand parameter, which is often used to hide commands. This type of codesHowever, it is often used to avoid static analysis by security solutions for illegitimate scripts.

Rule ID: PS-Encoded-Cmd-Detection-001.
Severity: High.
Description: "Detects running PowerShell with the --EncodedCommand parameter. This is often used by malware to hide commands and bypass security solutions.".
MITRE ATT&CK Tag: mitre.tactic: execution, mitre.technique_id: T1059, T1059.001.
Log Source: The ideal log source for determining the rule is Event ID 1 (Process creation) logs produced by Sysmon or Windows PowerShell Script Block Logging. These resources record the full command line arguments in detail.
Rule Logic:.
Kibana EQL (Event Query Language) Query:.
process where process.name == "powershell.exe" and process.command\_line : "\EncodedCommand\".
This query finds all events with powershell.exe in the process.name field and containing the EncodedCommand keyword in the process.command_line field.
False Positive Analysis: Legitimate administrative scripts can also sometimes encode and execute complex or sensitive commands. In such cases, rule noise can be reduced by creating exception lists for known and trusted management processes or IP addresses.

Rule Example 2: Deleting Shadow Copies with vssadmin.exe (T1490)

Although this technique is associated with the 'Impact' tactic, it is also directly related to the 'Execution' tactic as it starts with an attacker running a built-in Windows tool such as 'vssadmin.exe'. This rule detects deletion of shadow copies on the system, revealing threats to prevent data recovery.

Rule ID: VssAdmin-Shadow-Delete-002.
Severity: Critical.
Description: "Detects deletion of shadow copies using vssadmin.exe to prevent system integrity and data recovery.".
MITRE ATT&CK Tag: mitre.tactic: impact, mitre.technique_id: T1490.
Log Source: Although Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process creation) is the best source, Windows Security Event Logs can also be used.
Rule Logic:.
Kibana Custom Query (KQL):.
event.action:"Process Create (rule: ProcessCreate)" and process.name:"vssadmin.exe" and process.args:("delete" and "shadows").
This query searches for the execution of the vssadmin.exe process with the delete and shadows arguments in data collected with winlogbeat, such as Sysmon logs. Since legitimate use of this command is extremely rare, this rule is expected to produce a high-confidence alarm when triggered.

Section: Tactic: Discovery (Discovery — TA0007)

This tactic involves attackers trying to gather information about the environment after entering a network.

Section: Technique: T1087 Account Discovery

Attackers may attempt to enumerate local or domain accounts to find valid user accounts that they can use for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

Rule Example 1: Account Discovery with net.exe (T1087)

Windows' built-in net.exe tool is often used to list accounts and groups.

Rule ID: Net-User-Recon-003.
Severity: Moderate.
Description: "Detects the listing of local or domain accounts using Windows' built-in net.exe tool.".
MITRE ATT&CK Tag: mitre.tactic: discovery, mitre.technique_id: T1087.
Log Source: Sysmon Event ID 1, Windows Security Event Logs.
Rule Logic:.
Kibana EQL Query:.
process where (process.name == "net.exe" or process.name == "net1.exe") and process.command\_line: ("user" or "users").
This query captures events where net.exe or net1.exe processes are run with user or users arguments.
False Positive Analysis: System administrators can use these commands for routine tasks. Therefore, the rule may need to be used with additional context information such as process.parent_name or treated as a time window-based threshold rule.

Section: Technical: T1046 Network Service Discovery

Attackers perform port scanning to find potentially vulnerable services and open ports on the network.

Rule Example 2: Network Service Discovery (T1046)

This rule detects suspicious connection attempts (port scanning) from a single source to multiple destinations or ports.

Rule ID: Port-Scan-Detection-004.
Severity: Moderate.
Definition: "From a source, for a short timedetects suspicious connection attempts (port scanning) to multiple targets or ports in the slot.".
MITRE ATT&CK Tag: mitre.tactic: discovery, mitre.technique_id: T1046.
Log Source: Network flow logs, firewall logs collected with Packetbeat or Filebeat.
Rule Logic:.
Kibana Threshold Rule:.
Index: packetbeat-*.
Aggregated on: source.ip.
Field to count: destination.port.
Threshold: unique_count(destination.port) > 20 within 1 minute.
This rule detects cases that exceed a threshold by counting connection attempts from a single source IP address (source.ip) to more than 20 different destination ports (destination.port) within a minute.
False Positive Analysis: Load balancers, internal network scanning tools, or routine tests in development environments can trigger this rule. Therefore, it is necessary to create exception lists for known IP ranges or legitimate scanning tools.

Section: Rules Development Approach for Mobile and ICS Environments

The flexibility of the ELK Stack enables threat detection not only for traditional Enterprise environments, but also for the more niche Mobile and ICS (Industrial Control Systems) domains.

Section: Mobile Environments

The MITER ATT&CK for Mobile matrix includes tactics and techniques specific to Android and iOS platforms. Detecting mobile threats requires a different approach than traditional endpoint logging.

Log Sources: Mobile threats are often detected by in-app behavior or logs related to the device itself. Application developers can send logs directly to Logstash using logging libraries such as swift-log-elk. Additionally, Android's logcat tool can be used to monitor device logs via the adb command. Logs provided by Mobile Device Management (MDM) solutions are also a valuable resource for these analyses.
Rule Example (Theoretical): An attempt to access sensitive files (/etc/passwd) on a rooted Android device can be detected by looking for a specific process and file path combination in the logcat logs.

Section: ICS (Industrial Control Systems) Environments

MITER ATT&CK for ICS is specifically designed to model attacks targeting industrial processes. The biggest challenge in ICS environments is the processing and standardization of logs from proprietary industrial protocols (Modbus, OPC, PROFINET), unlike standard IT logs.

Log Sources: In addition to standard IT logs, logs from protocols specific to OT environments are vital. These logs are usually collected in the form of Windows Event Logs, text files or databases.
Rule Example (Theoretical): Unauthorized change of a PLC's operating mode (Run -> Program) or unusual collection of data over the OPC protocol can be detected by looking for a specific event pattern in the ICS logs.

Section: Integration and Ruleset Validation

In order for the created rule set to be functional and reliable, it must be correctly integrated into the ELK Stack and its effectiveness must be tested regularly.

Section: Uploading the Rule Set to ELK Stack

There are multiple ways to integrate rules into the ELK Stack. The most modern and manageable approach is to use Kibana's built-in Security application and APIs.

Kibana Security App: New rules can be created via the visual interface from Kibana's 'Security > Detections' section. This interface supports different types of rules, such as threat intelligence integration (Indicator match) or correlation rules.
Detection as Code (DaC): Ideal for larger teams and automation processes, this approach allows rules to be stored in a code repository (such as elastic/detection-rules) in the form of TOML or JSON files and automatically loaded into Kibana via the API. This method facilitates versioning of rules, integration into CI/CD processes, and intra-team collaboration.
Data Processing Integrations: According to the rule logic, Logstash pipelines or Ingest Node pipelines can be used to prepare the log data in the correct format. Logstash can perform in-depth transformations on data with complex filters (grok, mutate, geoip). Elasticsearch Ingest Node is used for simpler operations.

Section: Testing the Ruleset

To understand the potential of a rule set, it is not enough to know theoretically what it detects.is the province. It is vital to verify how effective the rule is in a real attack scenario. Atomic Red Team is an open source library of simple, isolated tests that emulate MITER ATT&CK techniques for this purpose.

Test Environment Preparation: First, an isolated test machine (VM) should be set up as a copy of the production environment. Necessary logging tools such as Sysmon and agents that send logs to ELK (e.g. Winlogbeat) must be running on this machine.
Selection and Application of the Test: Tests corresponding to the MITER ATT&CK technique (such as T1059) to be tested are selected from the Atomic Red Team library. These tests are run with a tool such as 'Invoke-AtomicRedTeam'.
Verification and Improvement: After the test is run, the logs are examined in Kibana to verify whether the created rule produces the expected alarm. If the rule does not fire or produces too many false positives, improvement is made by reviewing the rule logic or the log sources used. This is a feedback loop that ensures the ruleset remains constantly updated and effective.

Chapter: Integrated NOC/SOC and Layered Security Integration

The "Defense-in-Depth" (Derinlemesine Savunma) methodology aims to establish a multi-layered security shield against cyber threats instead of relying on a single security control. Just like the moats, walls, and towers of a medieval castle, modern enterprise cybersecurity must build a structure that makes it difficult for an attacker to reach their target and presents obstacles at every stage.

At the heart of this layered structure is an integrated NOC/SOC architecture where logs and events from all layers (Email, Endpoint, Network, Data, and Mobile) are collected and analyzed with correlation rules. Traditionally, the Network Operations Center (NOC) focuses on system uptime, performance, RAM/CPU, and disk utilization rates, while the Security Operations Center (SOC) tracks security threats and cyber attack traces. Consolidating these two units into a unified SIEM platform eliminates information silos, increases automatic correlation capabilities, and minimizes alert fatigue. Furthermore, keeping data on-premises rather than in the cloud offers a critical data sovereignty advantage for compliance with local regulations such as KVKK and GDPR.

The following architectural diagram illustrates the log flow of Libraesva ESG, Kaspersky KES, FortiGate, Zecurion DLP, and AppTec360 MDM components, and how this data is correlated on the central Elastic SIEM (on-premises) to enable unified NOC/SOC analysis:

[Mermaid Diagram: An architectural or flow diagram is present here. Diagram details are visually represented.]

Section: Layered Security Components and SIEM Integration

Critical security components in the defense-in-depth architecture offer the highest level of protection in their respective layers while feeding their telemetry into Elastic SIEM to facilitate incident response:

<div class="render-cards">
<div class="render-card render-card-csr">
<span class="render-badge">EMAIL SECURITY</span>
<h3>Libraesva ESG</h3>
<p>Deployed on-premises, Libraesva ESG scans inbound/outbound email traffic to detect phishing and BEC (Business Email Compromise) threats with a rate of over 99.9%. It opens attachments in a local sandbox to analyze zero-day threats. It conducts active URL analysis (time-of-click) and DMARC/SPF controls entirely on-premise, preventing data from leaving the local boundary. All detected phishing and spam alerts are forwarded to Elastic SIEM via Syslog or API.</p>
</div>
<div class="render-card render-card-ssr">
<span class="render-badge">ENDPOINT SECURITY</span>
<h3>Kaspersky KES</h3>
<p>Provides 100% protection against ransomware in the endpoint layer using machine learning and behavioral analysis. If any ransomware encryption attempt is detected, it terminates the process and restores affected files to their original state using "Automatic Rollover." It blocks unauthorized access to critical registry and system files via Host IPS (HIPS) and enforces application/device control policies. Security events are forwarded to Elastic SIEM in JSON/CEF format via Kaspersky Security Center (KSC).</p>
</div>
<div class="render-card render-card-ssg">
<span class="render-badge">NETWORK & IPS</span>
<h3>FortiGate UTM</h3>
<p>Consolidates Layer 7 application control, web filtering, antivirus, and IPS protection on a single platform at the gateway and segmentation boundaries. Powered by specialized hardware acceleration ASIC chips (SPU), it decrypts SSL/TLS traffic without performance degradation for deep packet inspection. It blocks suspicious network flows from external or internal segments and forwards blocked connection and IPS alerts to Elastic SIEM via rsyslog, providing the SOC team with critical lateral movement telemetry.</p>
</div>
<div class="render-card render-card-isr">
<span class="render-badge">DATA LEAKAGE (DLP)</span>
<h3>Zecurion DLP</h3>
<p>Monitors over 100 channels—including email, web uploads, printers, USB, and instant messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)—to prevent sensitive data leaks. It parses 500+ file formats, reads text inside images using OCR, and utilizes document fingerprinting technology. Its Screen Photo Detector utilizes webcam analysis to detect if a user is trying to photograph the screen with a phone, locking the computer immediately. Event logs and user behavior analysis (UBA) alerts are forwarded to Elastic SIEM.</p>
</div>
<div class="render-card render-card-csr">
<span class="render-badge">MOBILE SECURITY</span>
<h3>AppTec360 MDM</h3>
<p>Manages all corporate or personal (BYOD) mobile devices (iOS, Android, macOS, Windows) with central policies. It automates device enrollment out-of-the-box using Apple DEP and Google Enterprise integrations. Work data is kept isolated in an encrypted container, preventing data sharing with personal apps. It provides disk encryption, remote lock/wipe, and location tracking for lost/stolen devices. Root/jailbreak statuses and policy violation logs are routed to Elastic SIEM via Syslog/API.</p>
</div>
</div>

Thanks to this integrated layered architecture, for instance, a malicious sender's IP blocked by Libraesva can be instantly blacklisted on FortiGate; or a user generating data leakage alerts on Zecurion DLP can have their mobile device temporarily isolated from the network via AppTec360 MDM. All this cross-layer correlation and incident response automation is managed from a single point, powered by the on-premises Elastic SIEM infrastructure.

Section: Conclusion: Guide for Teams on Ruleset Usage and Further Reading

This report provides a detailed roadmap on the process of creating and managing a comprehensive incident detection ruleset based on the MITER ATT&CK framework on the ELK Stack. The findings reveal some key takeaways and best practices for cybersecurity teams that will use this ruleset.

Best Practices:

Prioritizing Threats: Identifying the most critical MITER ATT&CK tactics and techniques based on the organization's risk profile and threat intelligence creates a more focused and efficient defense strategy rather than activating all the rules.
Continuous Improvement: A ruleset is not a "create once and forget" resource. It should be tested and improved regularly for new threats, false positives, and changing infrastructure conditions. This continuous cycle is an approach that matures defensive capabilities.
Intra-Team Collaboration: Red and Blue teams collaborating is the most effective method to test and improve the effectiveness of the ruleset against realistic attack scenarios.

Future Recommendations:

Machine Learning (ML) Integration: Using ELK Stack's machine learning capabilities, it is possible to create rules that learn normal user and system behavior and detect abnormal deviations. This provides a huge advantage in catching new threats, especially those without known signatures.
Threat Intelligence Integration: Indicator Match rules can be created by integrating threat intelligence feeds (IoCs) directly into the ELK Stack. This enables rapid detection and alerting mechanisms against known malicious IPs, domains or file hashes.
Automated Response: As an advanced integration, combining detection rules with a SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response) platform can enable automatic response to alarms. For example, when a suspicious process is detected, automatic intervention actions can be taken, such as isolating the relevant host from the network or suspending the user's account.
