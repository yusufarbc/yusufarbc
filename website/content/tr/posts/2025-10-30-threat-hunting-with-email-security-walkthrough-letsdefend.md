### Using Email Security Systems

Email security systems help cybersecurity analysts detect and analyze suspicious activity. Detecting phishing emails and emails containing malware is one of their most important functions. Email security systems are equipped with advanced technologies such as machine learning algorithms, behavioral analysis, and threat intelligence. As a result, they are able to detect not only known threats, but also previously unseen or targeted attacks.

Using email security systems in the threat hunting process is critical to protecting corporate networks and data. These systems monitor not only incoming email traffic, but also internal email traffic, helping to detect insider threats. The effective use of email security systems in threat hunting is a critical step in preventing cyber-attacks and minimizing potential threats.

### Collection of Email Data and Log Analysis

The collection of email data and the analysis of these logs hold a significant place in threat hunting processes. Email logs contain critical information that organizations can use to monitor email traffic, detect anomalies, and take measures against cyberattacks.

**Collection of Email Data:** Email security systems can monitor all email traffic within an organization and securely store this data. This data may include sender and recipient email addresses, subject lines, IP addresses, email sizes, timestamps, and attachment details. Additionally, links used in emails and their target addresses can also be collected. Proper and complete collection of this data is crucial for detecting traces of cyberattacks during the threat hunting process.

**Log Analysis:** Email logs provide cybersecurity analysts with detailed information, enabling them to detect deviations from normal behavior and abnormal activities. Log analysis involves examining all email activities within a specific timeframe to identify potential threats. Abnormal activity includes unusual user email patterns, email from unknown IP addresses, or phishing attempts. Log analysis tools can automatically detect such anomalies and alert analysts, allowing potential threats to be identified and mitigated at an early stage.

Email data collection and log analysis is one of the fundamental elements of threat hunting. In order to detect threats in a timely manner and develop an effective defense strategy against cyber attacks, this process is critical.

### Detection and Analysis of Malicious Email Content

Detecting and analyzing malicious email content is an important defense mechanism in the cybersecurity world. Cyber attackers use a variety of techniques to spread malware, conduct phishing, or deceive users through email. Therefore, the detection and effective analysis of malicious content is essential to ensure the security of an organization.

* **Detection Methods:** There are several methods used to detect malicious email content. Signature-based detection methods are effective for identifying known threats. However, for more advanced attacks, techniques such as behavioral analysis, machine learning, and sandboxing are used. These methods analyze suspicious email content and detect anomalous behavior. For example, sandboxing executes email attachments in an isolated environment to test for malware.
* **Content Analysis:** Email content analysis involves a detailed examination of both text and attachments. Phishing emails often use specific patterns to deceive users, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used to detect these patterns. In addition, files in email attachments are scanned for known malware. Malicious email content often includes elements that pressure users to take certain actions (e.g., create a sense of urgency). Detecting such elements helps identify potential threats.
