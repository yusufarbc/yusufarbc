### Introduction

Threat hunting is a fundamental practice in modern cybersecurity strategies. It involves actively searching for potential security incidents and indicators of compromise (IOCs) that can evade traditional security measures. In this process, endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools play a critical role by providing security teams with the data and capabilities they need.

This course focuses on “Threat Hunting with EDR” and explores two key areas:

* The core function of EDR in threat hunting
* The importance of EDR data for threat hunting

Understanding the use of EDR tools in the threat hunting process, and the role of the data provided by these tools in threat detection and analysis, will allow us to develop the capabilities to respond more effectively and quickly to security events.

EDR tools can assist threat hunters in several ways. First, EDR tools provide rich and detailed data about your endpoints. You can use this data to create hypotheses, queries, and indicators of compromise (IOCs) for threat hunting. In addition, these tools allow you to instantly detect and analyze endpoint incidents, enabling you to respond quickly and effectively in the early stages of a cyber threat.

The data provided by EDR tools plays a critical role in every phase of the threat hunting process. During the data collection and enrichment phase, EDR tools collect information from multiple sources (logs, file activity, network connections, system events, and user behavior) and enrich this information with threat intelligence and contextual data. This enriched data makes it possible to detect threats in a more comprehensive and contextual manner.

This lesson has introduced the topic of Threat Hunting with EDR. The next lesson will cover “ **Importance of EDR Data for Threat Hunting** ”.

### IOC (Indicators of Compromise)

IOCs are specific indicators of a security breach or data leak. These indicators point to malicious activities occurring on a specific system or network.

**Examples:** Malicious file hashes, suspicious IP addresses, abnormal file paths, unknown or suspicious domains.

### Hunting for IOCs

* **Data Collection:** EDR tools continuously collect data from endpoints and networks. This data originates from various sources such as logs, file activities, and network traffic.
* **IOC Detection:** Collected data is compared with known IOCs. This comparison triggers alerts when malware or suspicious activities are detected.
* **Analysis:** Detected IOCs are analyzed in detail by cybersecurity experts. This analysis determines the source and spread methods of the threat.

### Use of IOCs

* **Quick Identification:** Known IOCs enable the rapid detection of identified threats. This allows for quick responses to security breaches.
* **Database Updates:** EDR tools continuously update IOC databases. These updates ensure that new threats are quickly recognized.

### IOA (Indicators of Attack)

IOAs are behavioral indicators that specify the intent or methodology of an attack. IOAs provide information about how attacks are carried out and the goals of attackers.

**Examples:** Attempts to delete files, unauthorized access attempts, compromised user accounts, system configuration changes.

### Hunting for IOAs

* **Behavioral Analysis:** EDR tools continuously monitor and analyze activities on endpoints and networks. This analysis identifies deviations from normal behavior patterns.
* **Anomaly Detection:** EDR tools use machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to detect abnormal activities and behaviors.
* **IOA Detection:** When compared to known IOAs, it increases the chances of detecting abnormal behavior as a potential attack.

### Use of IOAs

* **Determining Attack Intent:** IOAs help determine the intent and methodology of attacks, providing insight into the goals of attackers.
* **Proactive Defense:** IOAs enable the detection of threats at an early stage. This allows preventive measures to be taken before attacks occur.
* **Advanced Threat Hunting:** IOAs are effective not only in detecting known threats but also in identifying new and emerging threats. This enables cybersecurity experts to conduct more comprehensive and effective threat hunting.

### Conclusion

This lesson explained why the data provided by EDR tools is so important and its role in the threat hunting process.

### Core Functions of EDR in Threat Hunting

In the threat hunting process, endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions detect, investigate, respond to, and recover from threats, enabling security teams to quickly and effectively detect, analyze, and respond to potential threats. The threat hunting process becomes more effective and efficient with EDR tools’ comprehensive data collection, enrichment, analysis, and visualization features.

### Threat Detection

### Anomaly and Behavioral Detection

EDR tools continuously monitor activities on endpoints and analyze whether these activities deviate from normal behavior. For example, a particular user or device logging in at unusual times, unexpected file changes, or new software suddenly running can all be considered anomalous behavior.

They use anomaly detection algorithms to identify non-standard or suspicious activities. These anomalies may indicate potential threats and require further investigation.

### Threat Intelligence Integration

EDR tools integrate with up-to-date threat intelligence databases to track known malware, IP addresses, and other Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) enabling rapid detection of previously identified threats.

Real-time monitoring capabilities empower analysts to immediately identify threats and intervene in the early stages of attacks.

### Investigation

### Event Correlation and Analysis

* **Data Correlation**: EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools consolidate and correlate information from various data sources so that the users can have a better understanding of how attacks were carried out and which systems were affected.
* **Digital Forensic Analysis**: EDR tools collect and analyze detailed data for post-incident investigations. This process helps identify the attack’s origin, the methods used, and the attacker’s traces.

### Incident Investigation Tools

* **Timeline Creation:** EDR tools create timelines of events, clarifying the stages and timing of an attack.
* **File and Memory Analysis:** EDR tools analyze suspicious file and memory activities to trace malware and uncover potential threats.

### Response

### Incident Response and Isolation
