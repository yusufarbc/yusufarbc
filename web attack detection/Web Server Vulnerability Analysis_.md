# **A Threat Researcher's Compendium to Apache and IIS Security: Vulnerability Analysis, Hardening, and Advanced Detection with Splunk**

## **Part 1: The Apache HTTP Server Threat Landscape**

The Apache HTTP Server, for decades a cornerstone of the internet's infrastructure, has evolved significantly in its security profile. While its maturity has reduced the frequency of certain classic vulnerability types, its immense flexibility and role as a central proxy and application gateway have given rise to a new generation of threats. Understanding this modern landscape is critical for effective defense.

### **1.1. Anatomy of Apache Vulnerabilities: A Shift Towards Logical Flaws**

An analysis of recent vulnerabilities affecting the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x branch reveals a distinct trend away from simple buffer overflows in the server core and towards more nuanced, logical flaws. These vulnerabilities often arise not from a single coding error but from the complex interplay between modules, protocols, and, most importantly, specific server configurations. The modern attack surface of an Apache server is therefore defined less by its version number and more by the administrator's choices in its httpd.conf file.

This shift underscores a critical reality for defenders: an attacker targeting Apache is not just attacking the software, but the *unique combination of enabled modules and directives*. This context-dependent nature means that automated scanners may miss critical vulnerabilities, placing a greater emphasis on deep configuration knowledge and proactive hardening. The dominant vulnerability classes reflect this complexity:

* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** These flaws exploit the server's trusted position on a network to make unauthorized requests to internal resources or external services. SSRF has become a prominent threat, particularly within mod\_proxy and on Windows-based deployments where Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) paths can be abused to leak NTLM authentication hashes.1 Vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-43394 and CVE-2024-40898 exemplify this trend, where unvalidated input in  
  mod\_rewrite expressions can be used to craft requests to attacker-controlled servers.1  
* **HTTP Request Smuggling & Response Splitting:** These are sophisticated attacks that abuse inconsistencies in how a chain of servers (e.g., a front-end Apache proxy and a back-end application server) parse ambiguous HTTP requests. This can lead to access control bypass, web cache poisoning, and session hijacking. This vulnerability class is a recurring theme in proxy-related modules, including mod\_proxy\_ajp (CVE-2022-36760), mod\_proxy\_uwsgi (CVE-2023-27522), and even the server core itself when handling malicious response headers from a backend application.2 CVE-2024-42516 is a recent example of a response splitting flaw that required multiple patches to fully mitigate.2  
* **Path Traversal & Information Disclosure:** While a classic vulnerability, path traversal continues to appear in new and subtle ways. These flaws allow an attacker to access files or directories outside of the intended web root. Often, the root cause is improper input normalization or misconfigurations in powerful modules like mod\_rewrite. The critical vulnerability CVE-2021-41773, which affected Apache 2.4.49, allowed for path traversal and, if CGI scripts were enabled, remote code execution.2 More recent issues, such as CVE-2024-39884, demonstrate how regressions in handler configuration can lead to the disclosure of script source code (e.g., PHP files) instead of their execution.1  
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** As web protocols evolve, so do the vectors for DoS attacks. The introduction of HTTP/2, handled by mod\_http2, has created a new surface for resource exhaustion vulnerabilities. Attackers can trigger these flaws with crafted requests that lead to memory leaks (CVE-2023-45802), thread starvation (CVE-2019-9517), or null pointer dereferences that crash worker processes (CVE-2024-36387).2  
* **Module-Specific Flaws:** Apache's primary strength—its modularity—is also its most significant source of vulnerabilities. Flaws are rarely found in the minimalist server core but rather in the complex logic of its many modules. Examples abound, from access control bypasses in mod\_ssl (CVE-2025-23048) to out-of-bounds reads in mod\_dav (CVE-2006-20001) and buffer overflows in mod\_lua (CVE-2021-44790).2 This highlights that every enabled module contributes to the server's overall attack surface.

Statistical analysis confirms these trends. Over the last several years, vulnerability reports show a significant number of flaws related to memory corruption and SSRF, with Denial of Service being a consistently present impact type.3 This data paints a clear picture of a mature, yet complex, piece of software where security is a function of both code quality and administrative diligence.

### **1.2. Detailed Vulnerability and Mitigation Matrix (Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x)**

For security practitioners, a consolidated view of vulnerabilities is an essential tool for risk assessment and patch management. The following matrix details a selection of significant vulnerabilities in the Apache 2.4.x series, focusing on recent and high-impact issues. It provides the necessary context to understand the threat, its dependencies on specific configurations, and the required remediation steps.

### **1.3. Proactive Defense: Hardening the Apache Server**

Given that many vulnerabilities are configuration-dependent, proactive and thorough hardening is the most effective defense against attacks. A hardened server presents a minimal attack surface, rendering many exploits ineffective. The following best practices are essential for securing an Apache HTTP Server deployment.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** This is the foundational concept of Apache security.  
  * **Run as a Non-Privileged User:** Configure Apache to run as a dedicated, unprivileged user and group (e.g., www-data). This is typically set via the User and Group directives or environment variables like APACHE\_RUN\_USER.4 This ensures that if the server process is compromised, the attacker's access to the underlying system is severely limited.  
  * **Secure File System Permissions:** The ServerRoot directory and all its parent directories should be owned by root and not be writable by the Apache user.6 This prevents an attacker from modifying server binaries or configuration files.  
  * **Default-Deny Access Control:** The server configuration should start with a restrictive default policy, such as \<Directory /\> Require all denied \</Directory\>. Access should then be explicitly granted only to the specific directories that need to be served.6  
* **Minimize Attack Surface:** Every enabled feature is a potential vulnerability.  
  * **Disable Unused Modules:** Apache's modularity is a strength, but unused modules increase the attack surface. A thorough audit should be conducted to disable any modules that are not strictly necessary. This can be done by commenting out the corresponding LoadModule lines in the configuration.7 Modules like  
    mod\_dav, mod\_info, mod\_status, mod\_userdir, and mod\_proxy\_ftp are common candidates for disabling if their functionality is not required.7  
  * **Disable Dangerous Features:** Where possible, disable features that can introduce security risks. This includes disabling support for .htaccess files (AllowOverride None) to centralize configuration control, turning off Server-Side Includes (Options \-Includes), and preventing CGI script execution in user-controlled directories (Options \-ExecCGI).4  
  * **Limit Information Disclosure:** Prevent the server from leaking version and OS information by setting ServerTokens Prod and ServerSignature Off in the configuration.4 This makes it harder for attackers to identify version-specific exploits.  
* **Mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Configure directives to limit resource consumption.  
  * **Set Strict Timeouts:** Lower the values for TimeOut, KeepAliveTimeout, and RequestReadTimeout to prevent slow clients from holding connections open for extended periods.5  
  * **Limit Request Sizes:** Use directives like LimitRequestBody, LimitRequestFields, and LimitRequestFieldSize to place strict limits on the size and complexity of incoming requests, preventing resource exhaustion attacks.6  
* **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF):** For an additional layer of defense, especially against application-layer attacks like SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), deploy a WAF. ModSecurity is a widely used open-source WAF that integrates directly with Apache as a module and can be configured with rule sets like the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS).5  
* **Stay Updated:** Regularly patch the server. Subscribe to the Apache HTTP Server Announcements List to be notified of new releases and security advisories, and apply updates in a timely manner.5

## **Part 2: The Microsoft IIS Threat Landscape**

Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) presents a different security paradigm than Apache. Its deep integration with the Windows Server operating system means that its security is inextricably linked to the health of the entire underlying platform. Vulnerabilities in IIS are often vulnerabilities in core Windows components, leading to a distinct threat model.

### **2.1. Anatomy of IIS Vulnerabilities: A Story of Deep Integration**

Securing an IIS server is fundamentally an exercise in securing a Windows Server. The attack surface is not defined by a collection of independent modules as with Apache, but by a tightly integrated stack of system services, application frameworks, and kernel-mode drivers. An administrator must therefore think like a full-stack Windows administrator, as a vulnerability in any part of this stack can be exposed through the web server.

This integrated nature means that a single patch from Windows Update might fix a critical vulnerability in IIS, the.NET Framework, and the Windows kernel simultaneously. The most severe vulnerabilities often reside in these shared components, making their impact potentially system-wide.

* **Core Component Flaws (HTTP.sys):** The most critical vulnerabilities in the IIS ecosystem are often found in HTTP.sys, the kernel-mode device driver that directly handles HTTP requests for IIS.10 A flaw in this driver, such as the remote code execution vulnerability CVE-2015-1635, can be triggered by a single crafted HTTP packet and can lead to a complete system compromise.12 Because it operates in the kernel, a successful exploit grants the attacker the highest level of privilege.  
* **Authentication Bypass:** A recurring theme in IIS security is the bypassing of authentication mechanisms. This is particularly prevalent in extensions that handle complex authentication and authorization logic. The WebDAV extension has been a historical source of such flaws, with vulnerabilities like CVE-2009-1535 allowing attackers to bypass URI-based protection by using specially crafted Unicode characters in the URL.13 Similarly, CVE-2014-4078 showed how improper processing of wildcard rules in the "IP Address and Domain Restrictions" feature could allow attackers to circumvent access controls.12  
* **Privilege Escalation:** These vulnerabilities allow code running with the low privileges of an application pool identity to escalate its permissions to the powerful NT AUTHORITY\\system account. Such flaws, like CVE-2022-30209, often result from the main IIS worker process (w3wp.exe) failing to properly validate buffer lengths or perform other checks when interacting with lower-privilege code.10  
* **Application Framework Vulnerabilities:** The security of IIS is dependent on the security of the application frameworks it hosts. Flaws in ASP.NET, for example, can be exploited via IIS. A notable example is the padding oracle vulnerability (CVE-2010-3332) that allowed remote attackers to decrypt and modify encrypted ASP.NET \_\_VIEWSTATE data by observing detailed error messages provided by the framework.12  
* **Third-Party Application Integration:** The attack surface extends to any third-party software running on IIS. Vulnerabilities in applications like Trimble Cityworks (CVE-2025-0994) or Progress Telerik Report Server (CVE-2024-4358) can lead to remote code execution against the underlying IIS web server, even if IIS itself is fully patched.12

### **2.2. Detailed Vulnerability and Mitigation Matrix (Microsoft IIS)**

The following matrix provides a reference for significant vulnerabilities across various versions of Microsoft IIS. It highlights the diversity of affected components, from the kernel-mode HTTP.sys driver to application-level extensions like WebDAV and the FTP Service. This demonstrates the integrated nature of the IIS threat landscape and the importance of comprehensive system patching.

| CVE ID | Description | Vulnerability Type / CWE | Impact | Affected IIS Versions & Components | Mitigation / Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **CVE-2015-1635** | A remote code execution vulnerability in the HTTP Protocol Stack (HTTP.sys) could be triggered by a crafted HTTP request. | RCE | Critical | IIS 7.x, 8.x on Windows 7, 8, Server 2008 R2, Server 2012/R2 (HTTP.sys) | Patched |
| **CVE-2017-7269** | A buffer overflow in the WebDAV service in IIS 6.0 could be exploited via a long "If" header in a PROPFIND request, leading to RCE. | RCE (Buffer Overflow) | Critical | IIS 6.0 on Windows Server 2003 R2 (WebDAV) | Patched (OS is End-of-Life) |
| **CVE-2021-31166** | A remote code execution vulnerability in the HTTP Protocol Stack (HTTP.sys) could be triggered by a crafted packet sent to a targeted server. | RCE | Critical | IIS on Windows 10, Server 2019, Server 20H2 (HTTP.sys) | Patched |
| **CVE-2009-1535** | The WebDAV extension allowed remote attackers to bypass URI-based protection by using a crafted Unicode character sequence in the URL. | Authentication Bypass | Important | IIS 5.1, 6.0 (WebDAV) | Patched; Workaround: Disable WebDAV |
| **CVE-2022-30209** | An elevation of privilege vulnerability existed in the Windows IIS Server, allowing an attacker to execute code as SYSTEM. | Privilege Escalation | High | IIS on various Windows versions | Patched |
| **CVE-2010-3972** | A heap-based buffer overflow in the FTP Service allowed remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted FTP command. | RCE (Buffer Overflow) | High | IIS 7.0, 7.5 (FTP Service) | Patched |
| **CVE-2023-36899** | A remote code execution vulnerability existed in Microsoft IIS when it was used with the Windows Media Services (WMS) server role. | RCE | High | IIS with Windows Media Services | Patched |
| **CVE-2014-4078** | The "IP Address and Domain Restrictions" feature did not properly process wildcard rules, allowing remote attackers to bypass the intended rule set. | Security Feature Bypass | Medium | IIS 8.0, 8.5 | Patched |

### **2.3. Proactive Defense: Hardening the IIS Server**

Securing an IIS server requires a holistic approach that addresses the web server configuration, the underlying operating system, and all hosted applications. A structured hardening methodology is crucial for systematically reducing the attack surface.

* **Adhere to CIS Benchmarks:** The Center for Internet Security (CIS) provides comprehensive, consensus-based hardening guides for Microsoft IIS. The CIS Microsoft IIS Benchmarks offer hundreds of specific, actionable configuration recommendations that form a robust security baseline.16 Organizations should use these benchmarks as a primary guide for their hardening efforts and can leverage tools like CIS-CAT Pro to automate compliance checking.  
* **Operating System Hardening:** IIS security is built upon the security of the Windows Server OS. This includes standard OS hardening practices such as applying all security patches via Windows Update, removing unnecessary server roles and features, enforcing strong password policies, and implementing the principle of least privilege for all user accounts.4  
* **Minimize the IIS Attack Surface:**  
  * **Install Only Necessary Components:** During the initial IIS installation via Server Manager, only install the role services that are absolutely required. Features like the FTP Server, WebDAV Publishing, and the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) client should not be installed unless they are essential.13  
  * **Configure Request Filtering:** The Request Filtering module is a powerful tool for blocking malicious requests before they reach application code. It should be configured to:  
    * Deny requests for unlisted file extensions.  
    * Block hidden segments (e.g., web.config, bin folders).  
    * Enforce strict limits on URL length, query string length, and overall request size.  
    * Deny requests containing double-encoded characters or high-bit characters.  
* **Isolate Applications with Application Pools:** Each web application should run in its own dedicated application pool. Each pool should be configured to run under a unique, low-privilege virtual account (ApplicationPoolIdentity) rather than powerful built-in accounts like Network Service. This compartmentalizes applications, so a compromise in one does not immediately affect others.  
* **Enable and Secure Logging:** Detailed logging is critical for forensic analysis and threat detection. Ensure that logging is enabled for all sites and that, at a minimum, standard W3C fields like client IP, user-agent, URI, and status code are recorded. Log files should be stored on a separate partition with strict Access Control Lists (ACLs) to prevent tampering by a compromised application or the IUSR account.12  
* **Use Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Disable anonymous authentication for any site or application that does not require public access. Use URL Authorization Rules to enforce granular, least-privilege access to files and directories.  
* **Keep All Components Updated:** A comprehensive patching strategy is non-negotiable. This includes not only IIS itself but also the underlying Windows Server OS, the.NET Framework, and any third-party applications or modules running on the server.17

## **Part 3: Universal Threat Detection Methodologies**

While proactive hardening is the first line of defense, a robust detection strategy is necessary to identify vulnerabilities and active attacks that bypass preventative controls. These detection methodologies are largely platform-agnostic and form the basis of a modern security monitoring program for any web server.

### **3.1. Foundational Detection Strategies**

Effective threat detection is not the result of a single tool but a multi-layered process where different techniques provide complementary visibility. A comprehensive program integrates automated scanning to find potential weaknesses with continuous monitoring to find active exploitation.

* **Vulnerability Scanning:** This involves actively or passively probing systems to identify known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  
  * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** DAST tools, such as Burp Suite Scanner or OWASP ZAP, interact with a running web application from the outside, much like an attacker would. They send crafted payloads to probe for common runtime vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection (SQLi), Directory Traversal, and Open Redirects.18 DAST can be performed in two modes:  
    *passive scanning*, which analyzes normal HTTP traffic for weaknesses without sending intrusive requests, and *active scanning*, which sends malicious payloads to confirm vulnerabilities.18  
  * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** In contrast to DAST, SAST tools analyze an application's source code or compiled binaries without executing the application. This allows for the discovery of vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, before the code is ever deployed.20  
  * **Network and Infrastructure Scanning:** Tools like Nessus or Qualys scan servers from a network perspective. They can identify out-of-date software versions (e.g., an unpatched Apache or IIS), weak SSL/TLS configurations, and other service-level misconfigurations that create risk.21  
* **Configuration and Patch Auditing:** This is the process of verifying that systems are hardened and patched according to policy.  
  * **Patch Management:** A fundamental security control is ensuring that all software—the operating system, the web server, content management systems (CMS), and all plugins—is up to date. An out-of-date component is often the single weakest link that leads to a compromise.17  
  * **Configuration Scanning:** Automated tools, such as CIS-CAT Pro, can scan a server's configuration and compare it against a known security baseline, like the CIS Benchmarks.16 This provides a detailed report of any deviations from a hardened state, allowing administrators to systematically address security gaps.

This layered approach ensures that security is addressed from multiple angles. SAST finds flaws in the code, DAST finds flaws in the running application, infrastructure scanners find flaws in the server's network posture, and configuration scanners find gaps in hardening. No single method is sufficient, but together they form a powerful preventative and detective strategy.

### **3.2. Forensic Analysis of Web Server Logs**

Web server logs are the ground truth for attack detection. They provide a detailed, chronological record of every request handled by the server, making them an invaluable resource for forensic investigation and real-time threat hunting.22 Understanding how to read these logs and identify indicators of malicious activity is a fundamental skill for any security analyst.

* **Log Types and Formats:** Both Apache and IIS generate several types of logs, but the most critical for attack detection are the access logs.  
  * **Access Logs:** Record every successful request processed by the server. A typical log entry contains the client's IP address, a timestamp, the HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc.), the requested URI, the HTTP status code returned, the size of the response, the referrer URL, and the client's User-Agent string.22  
  * **Error Logs:** Record server-side errors, such as scripts timing out, configuration problems, or modules failing to load. These can be useful for diagnosing server health and sometimes indicate the side effects of an attack.  
  * **Security Logs:** Some systems or modules may generate specific security-related logs, such as failed login attempts or WAF block events.22  
* **Identifying Indicators of Attack (IoAs):** The key to log analysis is distinguishing malicious requests from benign traffic. This requires familiarity with common attack patterns.  
  * **Reconnaissance and Scanning:** Attackers almost always begin by scanning for vulnerabilities. This appears in logs as a high volume of requests from a single IP address in a short period, often generating a large number of 404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden errors as the scanner probes for non-existent files or forbidden directories. These scans often look for common administrative interfaces (/phpmyadmin, /wp-admin), sensitive files (/.env, /web.config), or known vulnerable paths.23  
  * **SQL Injection (SQLi):** This is identified by the presence of SQL syntax within URL parameters or POST data. Look for keywords like SELECT, UNION, INSERT; comment characters such as \--, \#, or /\*; and common attack strings like ' OR '1'='1.23  
  * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** XSS attempts are visible as HTML and JavaScript code in request parameters. Common indicators include \<script\>, \<iframe\>, and event handlers like onerror or onload.23  
  * **Path Traversal:** These attacks are characterized by directory traversal sequences in the requested URI. Analysts should search for ../, ..\\\\, and their various URL-encoded forms, such as %2e%2e%2f (for ../) and %2e%2e%5c (for ..\\\\).25  
  * **Brute-Force Attacks:** A brute-force attack on a login page will appear as a high number of POST requests to a specific URL (e.g., /login.php, /wp-login.php) from a single source IP, typically resulting in status codes that indicate failure (e.g., 200 with an error message, or a 401 Unauthorized).22

The effectiveness of this manual analysis hinges on a critical prerequisite: **baselining**. An analyst must be intimately familiar with what constitutes "normal" traffic for their web application.26 Without a baseline, it is impossible to spot anomalies. Baselining involves understanding typical traffic volume, the most commonly accessed URLs, the expected distribution of HTTP status codes (e.g., mostly

200 OK and 304 Not Modified), and the legitimate User-Agent strings used by clients. The goal of automated detection systems like a SIEM is to codify this baseline and automatically flag significant deviations, transforming log analysis from a manual, reactive process into a proactive, automated hunt for threats.

## **Part 4: Advanced Threat Detection and Hunting with Splunk**

For organizations managing web servers at scale, manual log analysis is not feasible. A Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform like Splunk is essential for aggregating logs, normalizing data, and automating threat detection. This section provides a practical guide for security analysts and detection engineers to leverage Splunk for hunting threats against Apache and IIS servers.

### **4.1. The Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) for Web Traffic**

The primary challenge in analyzing logs from multiple sources is the lack of a standard format. Apache logs are formatted differently from IIS logs, which are different from WAF logs. The Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) solves this problem by providing a standardized set of fields and tags for different data types, acting as a search-time schema or "schema-on-the-fly".27

For web security, the Web data model is the most important. It normalizes disparate web log sources into a single, unified structure. By mapping the raw data from an Apache or IIS Add-on to the Web data model, analysts can write a single query that works across all their web traffic sources, regardless of the original vendor or format.27

To ensure performance, especially in large-scale environments, data models should be **accelerated**. Acceleration creates a separate, summarized copy of the data in a highly efficient format, which dramatically speeds up searches and dashboards that use the data model.28

The following table serves as a "Rosetta Stone," mapping key fields from the Web data model to their typical counterparts in raw Apache or IIS logs. Understanding this mapping is crucial for writing and troubleshooting CIM-compliant queries.

| CIM Field Name | Description | Example Raw Log Source (Apache/IIS) | Example Attack Indicator |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Web.src | The source IP address of the client making the request. | Apache: %h, IIS: c-ip | A single IP making thousands of requests. |
| Web.dest | The destination IP or hostname of the web server. | (Derived from host/index) | N/A |
| Web.url | The full requested URL, including the query string. | Apache: "%r", IIS: cs-uri-stem \+ cs-uri-query | Contains ' OR 1=1-- (SQLi) or ../../etc/passwd (Path Traversal). |
| Web.http\_method | The HTTP method used in the request. | Apache: "%m", IIS: cs-method | POST to a login page in a brute-force attack. |
| Web.status | The HTTP status code returned by the server. | Apache: %\>s, IIS: sc-status | High counts of 404 or 403 from one source indicate scanning. |
| Web.http\_user\_agent | The User-Agent string sent by the client's browser. | Apache: "%{User-Agent}i", IIS: cs(User-Agent) | A malicious scanner might use a unique or suspicious User-Agent. |
| Web.action | The action taken by a security device (e.g., WAF). | (From WAF logs) | blocked |
| Web.url\_length | The length of the URL field. | (Calculated by Splunk) | Unusually long URLs can be a sign of complex injection attacks. |

### **4.2. Detection Engineering with SPL: A Practical Guide**

The following Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) queries are designed to detect common web attack techniques. They are written to use the Web data model for maximum compatibility and leverage tstats, a high-performance command that is most effective against accelerated data models.29 Each query includes a breakdown of its logic and advice for tuning.

#### **4.2.1. Detecting SQL Injection (SQLi)**

* **Attack Logic:** Attackers inject SQL commands into URL parameters or other inputs to manipulate the application's database queries.31  
* **Detection Strategy:** This query combines two techniques: it looks for anomalously long URLs, which are often used to carry complex payloads, and it searches for common SQL keywords and comment characters within the URL itself.32  
* **The SPL Query:**  
  Splunk SPL

| tstats security\_content\_summariesonly count min(\_time) as firstTime max(\_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web where (Web.url\_length \> 1024 OR Web.http\_user\_agent\_length \> 200 OR Web.url="SELECT" OR Web.url="UNION" OR Web.url="--" OR Web.url="' OR") by Web.src, Web.dest, Web.url, Web.http\_user\_agent  
| drop\_dm\_object\_name("Web")  
| security\_content\_ctime(firstTime)  
| security\_content\_ctime(lastTime)  
| rex field=url "(?i)(select|union|--|' or '1'='1'|sp\_configure|xp\_cmdshell)" max\_match=0 | eval sql\_keywords=mvjoin(field, ", ")  
| where isnotnull(sql\_keywords) OR url\_length \> 1024  
| table firstTime, lastTime, src, dest, url, http\_user\_agent, sql\_keywords, count  
\`\`\`

* **Query Breakdown:**  
  1. | tstats... from datamodel=Web where...: This is the core search command. It efficiently queries the accelerated Web data model. The where clause filters for events that are potentially interesting: either the URL or User-Agent is unusually long, or the URL contains common SQL injection patterns.32  
  2. | rex field=url...: This command uses a regular expression to extract the *specific* SQL keywords found within the URL. This is more precise than a simple wildcard search and provides valuable context for the analyst.34  
  3. | where isnotnull(sql\_keywords) OR url\_length \> 1024: This final filter ensures that we only see results that either contained a matched keyword or had an anomalous length.  
  4. | table...: This formats the output into a human-readable table for investigation.  
* **Tuning and False Positives:** The URL length threshold (1024) may need to be adjusted for applications that legitimately use long URLs. The list of SQL keywords can be expanded to include database-specific functions or additional attack patterns. Legitimate requests may occasionally contain words like "select" or "union," so context is key.

#### **4.2.2. Detecting Path Traversal and Local File Inclusion (LFI)**

* **Attack Logic:** Attackers use directory traversal sequences (../) to access files outside of the intended web root directory.35  
* **Detection Strategy:** This query searches for common path traversal sequences and their URL-encoded variants within the requested URL.36  
* **The SPL Query:**  
  Splunk SPL

| tstats security\_content\_summariesonly count min(\_time) as firstTime max(\_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Web where (Web.url="../" OR Web.url="..%5c" OR Web.url="..%2f" OR Web.url="%2e%2e%2f") by Web.src, Web.dest, Web.url  
| drop\_dm\_object\_name("Web")  
| security\_content\_ctime(firstTime)  
| security\_content\_ctime(lastTime)  
| rex field=url "(?\<traversal\_pattern\>(../|..\\|%2e%2e%2f|%2e%2e%5c))"  
| table firstTime, lastTime, src, dest, url, traversal\_pattern, count  
\`\`\`

* **Query Breakdown:**  
  1. | tstats... where...: The where clause is the heart of this detection, using wildcards to find multiple variations of the ../ sequence, including plain text and common URL encodings for the dot (.), forward slash (/), and backslash (\\) characters.  
  2. | rex field=url...: This rex command extracts the specific traversal pattern found, which can help an analyst understand the exact technique being used.  
* **Tuning and False Positives:** This query has a low false positive rate, as these patterns are highly indicative of malicious intent. However, poorly written web applications might generate URLs containing these strings legitimately. Such applications should be identified and their traffic can be excluded from the search.

#### **4.2.3. Detecting Command Injection and RCE**

* **Attack Logic:** Attackers inject operating system commands into a vulnerable application parameter, which are then executed by the server.38  
* **Detection Strategy:** This query looks for common OS commands and script interpreters within the URL. This is a high-level indicator and is most powerful when correlated with endpoint data.  
* **The SPL Query (Web Data):**  
  Splunk SPL

| tstats security\_content\_summariesonly count from datamodel=Web where (Web.url="whoami" OR Web.url="uname" OR Web.url="powershell" OR Web.url="cmd.exe" OR Web.url=";cat") by Web.src, Web.dest, Web.url  
| drop\_dm\_object\_name("Web")  
| rex field=url "(?i)(whoami|uname|powershell|cmd.exe|/bin/sh|cat /etc/passwd|ncat|nc.exe)" max\_match=0 | eval commands\_found=mvjoin(field, ", ")  
| where isnotnull(commands\_found)  
| table \_time, src, dest, url, commands\_found, count  
\`\`\`

* **Query Breakdown:**  
  1. | tstats... where...: This performs an initial broad search for URLs containing the names of common command-line tools.  
  2. | rex...: The regular expression extracts the specific commands found.  
* **Tuning and False Positives:** This query can be noisy. Its true power is realized when its results are correlated with endpoint logs. A more advanced hunt would involve joining the src and dest from these web events with endpoint data (e.g., from the Endpoint data model) to find instances where a web server process (like httpd.exe or w3wp.exe) spawns a child process like cmd.exe or powershell.exe shortly after one of these web requests is observed.40

#### **4.2.4. Detecting Reconnaissance and Brute-Force Attempts**

* **Attack Logic:** Scanners probe for many different pages, generating errors. Brute-force attacks repeatedly hit a single login page.  
* **Detection Strategy:** This query uses statistical analysis to find anomalies. It identifies source IPs that have requested an unusually high number of distinct pages that resulted in a 404 Not Found error, a strong indicator of a directory scanning tool.  
* **The SPL Query (Scanning):**  
  Splunk SPL

| tstats security\_content\_summariesonly dc(Web.url) as distinct\_url\_count from datamodel=Web where Web.status=404 by Web.src  
| where distinct\_url\_count \> 50  
| sort \- distinct\_url\_count  
\`\`\`

* **Query Breakdown:**  
  1. | tstats dc(Web.url)... where Web.status=404 by Web.src: This command efficiently calculates the *distinct count* (dc) of unique URLs requested by each source IP (Web.src), but only for requests that resulted in a 404 status code.30  
  2. | where distinct\_url\_count \> 50: This filters the results to show only those IPs that have generated more than 50 "Not Found" errors for unique pages, a strong sign of scanning.  
* **Tuning and False Positives:** The threshold (50) is the primary tuning parameter and should be adjusted based on normal traffic patterns. Search engine crawlers can sometimes exhibit similar behavior, so their IP ranges might need to be excluded. A similar query can be built to detect brute-force attacks by filtering on http\_method=POST, a specific login URL, and counting non-successful status codes (status\!=200, status\!=302).

### **4.3. Operationalizing Detections**

Writing queries is only the first step. To be effective, these detections must be integrated into a security operations workflow.

* **Data Model Acceleration:** As stated previously, accelerating the Web data model is critical for performance. In a production Splunk environment, running these queries against large volumes of unaccelerated data would be too slow. Acceleration involves a trade-off between disk space on the indexers and search performance.28  
* **Leveraging tstats:** All the provided queries use tstats because it is specifically designed to work with accelerated data models and the tsidx files that store the summarized data. It is significantly faster than using a raw search command for this type of statistical analysis.29  
* **Tuning and False Positive Reduction:** In a real-world environment, legitimate traffic can sometimes trigger these queries. The best practice for managing this is to use macros for allow-listing, a technique employed in Splunk's own security content.32 For example, an analyst could create a macro containing the IP addresses of known, authorized vulnerability scanners. This macro can then be added to the SPL queries to filter out noise without modifying the core detection logic.  
* **From Hunting to Alerting:** Once a query has been tuned and validated, it can be converted from a manual hunting tool into an automated alert. This is done by saving the search as a Report and configuring it to run on a schedule (e.g., every hour). It is crucial to set actionable alert thresholds to avoid overwhelming analysts with low-fidelity alerts, a phenomenon known as "alert fatigue".42 An alert should only fire when there is a high confidence of a genuine threat that requires action.

## **Part 5: Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations**

The security landscapes of Apache and Microsoft IIS, while different in their specifics, lead to a unified set of strategic principles for defense. Effective security is not a static state achieved by a one-time configuration but a dynamic, intelligence-driven process of continuous adaptation and monitoring.

### **Summary of Key Findings**

This analysis has revealed several critical truths about modern web server security:

* **Divergent Threat Models:** The primary risk for an Apache server lies in its modularity and the complexity of its configuration. For IIS, the risk is rooted in its deep integration with the underlying Windows operating system and its shared components. Securing Apache requires the mindset of a specialist in its configuration language, while securing IIS demands the broader perspective of a Windows systems administrator.  
* **The Primacy of Logical Flaws:** While memory corruption vulnerabilities still exist, the most prevalent and impactful threats today are logical flaws. Attacks like Server-Side Request Forgery, HTTP Request Smuggling, and configuration-dependent path traversals now dominate the threat landscape for mature web servers.  
* **Defense-in-Depth is Non-Negotiable:** No single tool or technique is sufficient. A resilient security posture requires a layered strategy that combines proactive OS and server hardening, automated vulnerability scanning to identify weaknesses, and vigilant, log-based threat detection to catch active exploitation attempts.

### **A Continuous Improvement Cycle**

The content of this report should not be viewed as a static checklist but as the components of a continuous security improvement cycle. This loop ensures that defensive measures evolve in response to the ever-changing threat environment.

1. **Harden:** Begin by implementing the proactive defense strategies detailed in Parts 1.3 and 2.3. Minimize the attack surface by disabling unused modules and features, apply the principle of least privilege, and follow established benchmarks like those from CIS. This is the foundation of the entire security program.  
2. **Detect:** Deploy the advanced detection queries from Part 4 within a SIEM like Splunk. Accelerate the necessary data models and tune the queries to establish a baseline of normal activity and begin hunting for the attack patterns that target the remaining, hardened attack surface.  
3. **Analyze:** When a detection query fires an alert, use the detailed vulnerability matrices in Parts 1.2 and 2.2 as a rapid reference tool. This allows an analyst to quickly understand the context of the potential attack: its severity, the specific components it targets, and the known mitigations.  
4. **Respond & Refine:** The intelligence gathered from detected attacks and near-misses must feed back into the hardening and detection processes. An attempted SQL injection attack found in the logs 26 should trigger not only an incident response but also a review of WAF rules and potentially the creation of a more specific, higher-fidelity Splunk alert. This feedback loop ensures the defense becomes progressively stronger and more intelligent over time.

### **Final Recommendation**

The ultimate goal is to build a resilient web infrastructure. This is achieved by treating security not as a project with an end date, but as an ongoing operational discipline. By combining rigorous, systematic hardening with intelligent, data-driven threat detection, organizations can build a defensive posture that is capable of withstanding the sophisticated and persistent threats targeting today's most critical web services.
