                <p>In recent years, Microsoft has clearly adopted a “cloud-first” approach, positioning its products —
                    such as Windows Server, identity management, and others — to integrate closely with the Azure cloud.
                </p>

                <p>For example, Microsoft’s documentation emphasizes that Windows Server 2022 introduces innovations
                    based on the core themes of “security, Azure hybrid integration, and management.” The Windows Server
                    2022 Datacenter: Azure Edition even offers features that “leverage cloud benefits to keep VMs up to
                    date without disruption,” including cloud-oriented innovations such as Hotpatch, SMB over QUIC, and
                    Azure Extended Networking.</p>

                <p>This demonstrates that Microsoft is prioritizing Azure and cloud integration in both product
                    innovations and management methods.</p>

                <h2>The State of On-Prem Products: Declining and Evolving Tools</h2>
                <p>Microsoft’s strategy is not to immediately phase out on-premises infrastructure entirely but rather
                    to steer it toward Azure-centric hybrid management. However, development has slowed for some classic
                    tools:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>WSUS (Windows Server Update Services):</strong> In September 2024, Microsoft announced
                        that WSUS had been “deprecated.” No new feature investments will be made for WSUS, and new
                        feature requests will not be accepted. Existing functionality will be maintained, and the role
                        will continue to exist in Windows Server 2025.
                        <br><br>
                        However, this move is intended to direct enterprises toward cloud-based patch management
                        solutions like Windows Autopatch, Intune, and Azure Update Manager. In short, WSUS is still
                        usable, but no new innovations should be expected; Microsoft has clearly signaled its strategy
                        to shift update management to cloud tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Windows Admin Center (WAC):</strong> Active development continues for this management
                        tool. For example, the WAC 2410 release in December 2024 included a .NET 8 update, improvements
                        to virtual machine and security tools, and various bug fixes. Additionally, cloud-oriented
                        innovations such as large-scale integration with Azure Arc and Azure Migrate assessments are
                        regularly added. This makes WAC one of the few on-prem tools that continues to receive major
                        updates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Azure Stack / Azure Stack HCI (Azure Local):</strong> Formerly known as Azure Stack HCI,
                        now branded as Azure Local, this is an infrastructure actively developed for hybrid/on-premises
                        scenarios. The latest version of Azure Local introduces features focused on cloud-based
                        deployment and updates, cloud monitoring, and management via Azure.
                        <br><br>
                        For instance, the latest release announcement emphasized that “Azure Stack HCI is now part of
                        Azure Local” and that the new version simplifies cloud-based deployment/updates and VM
                        management. Thus, Microsoft is not entirely abandoning on-prem hardware but is positioning this
                        infrastructure as a hybrid platform “unified with Azure.”
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Identity Management: The Status of On-Prem AD</h2>
                <p>The dominant trend in Microsoft’s identity solutions is similarly cloud-centric. Azure AD / Microsoft
                    Entra ID is maturing rapidly as Microsoft’s cloud identity platform.</p>

                <p>For example, the Azure AD Graph API (a legacy identity API) will be fully retired by the end of 2025,
                    with all new identity functionality being delivered through Microsoft Graph. This indicates that new
                    applications and integrations are increasingly relying on Azure AD/Entra APIs.</p>

                <p>However, Microsoft is not claiming that on-prem AD will disappear immediately. In fact, future
                    versions of Windows Server (e.g., 2025) include significant improvements for Active Directory Domain
                    Services (AD DS). For instance, Windows Server 2025 features innovations such as optionally
                    increasing the database page size from 8k to 32k (to support more multi-value attributes), new
                    schema updates, LAPS (Local Admin Password Solution) enhancements, and multi-core performance
                    improvements.</p>

                <p>This shows that on-prem AD remains technically robust. That said, Microsoft explicitly encourages the
                    use of hybrid identity in new solutions: tools like Azure AD Connect and Azure AD Join build bridges
                    between on-prem AD and Azure AD, and the long-term recommendation is to host workloads on Entra ID.
                    In summary, on-prem AD is “not ending immediately,” but most investments are shifting to the
                    cloud-based identity platform.</p>

                <h2>Data Privacy and Data Sovereignty Concerns</h2>
                <p>One of the most questioned aspects of Microsoft’s cloud strategy is data sovereignty and privacy.
                    Microsoft commits to protecting customer data, including within the EU. For example, according to
                    Reuters, Microsoft announced that European cloud customers’ data would remain in Europe and be
                    subject to oversight by local teams under European laws. Additional measures include keeping data
                    local and requiring remote access to be approved by European personnel.</p>

                <p>However, legal frameworks complicate these commitments. Due to regulations like the U.S. CLOUD Act,
                    Microsoft is obligated to provide data when presented with a legally valid request. In fact,
                    Microsoft France’s General Counsel admitted in a June 2025 inquiry that “if requests from the U.S.
                    are made in the correct form, Microsoft must provide the data.”</p>

                <p>As reported by Heise, this has raised concerns across Europe, with analysts warning that the CLOUD
                    Act could lead to global data requests. Similarly, The Register stated that “Microsoft must hand
                    over data if a properly formatted request is made.” In other words, Microsoft cannot absolutely
                    guarantee the protection of data stored in the EU against international legal demands.</p>

                <p>To address these concerns, Microsoft is working on new solutions like Azure Confidential Computing
                    and initiatives such as “Microsoft for Sovereignty,” which offer advanced encryption and local
                    operation guarantees. Additionally, customer-managed keys (CMK/BYOK) are supported, allowing data to
                    be encrypted with your own keys.</p>

                <p>These options provide an extra layer of protection, but legal demands still pose systematic,
                    surmountable risks. Even if infrastructure is physically located in Europe, valid court orders from
                    the U.S. and other countries can directly impact data access.</p>

                <p>Microsoft’s “Data Residency” commitment documents also state that data will remain in the customer’s
                    chosen geography: “Customer data will be stored in the selected region, and Microsoft will not move
                    it outside geographic boundaries.” Furthermore, Microsoft states that it will not have “direct,
                    unrestricted access” to data keys or content without the customer’s explicit permission.</p>

                <p>However, these policies may be amended in accordance with applicable laws if a government request
                    arises. In short, geographical location alone does not provide absolute assurance, and organizations
                    must strengthen their own encryption and audit layers.</p>

                <h2>Recommendations for On-Prem-Only Enterprises</h2>
                <p>For organizations that never allow data to leave their premises or rely solely on on-prem
                    infrastructure, adopting a cautious hybrid strategy without completely cutting ties to the cloud is
                    the most sensible approach. Below are some technical, administrative, and legal measures that can be
                    taken:</p>

                <h3>Technical Measures:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inventory and Comprehensive Mapping:</strong> Identify all your data and applications,
                        including where and how they are used in the cloud. Which data is sensitive? Which can be moved?
                        Use tools like Azure Migrate to analyze your infrastructure and identify cloud integrations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Azure Local / HCI Solutions:</strong> To reduce on-prem dependency, consider Azure Local
                        (formerly Azure Stack HCI) or supported HCI solutions. These products bring many Azure services
                        to the local environment or enable Azure-centric management, allowing data to remain on-prem
                        while management is unified through Azure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Customer-Managed Keys (CMK/BYOK):</strong> Use customer-controlled encryption keys for
                        Azure and Microsoft 365 services. By hosting keys in your own Azure Key Vault or on-prem HSM,
                        you can create an additional control layer that limits Microsoft’s direct access to encrypted
                        data. (Note: Legal requests for access to your keys may still occur, but this creates technical
                        barriers.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Air-Gapped Solutions:</strong> If data must absolutely never leave the organization, the
                        most secure (though costly) approach is to keep critical data in a completely isolated
                        (air-gapped) environment. This environment would have no internet access or integration with
                        external services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid Identity and Management:</strong> Use hybrid solutions like federation (AD FS) or
                        Azure AD Connect for identity management where AD/required applications are needed. For
                        management, prefer tools like Windows Admin Center + System Center or Azure Arc to connect
                        on-prem devices to Azure management endpoints.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Contractual and Legal Measures:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privacy/DPA Agreements:</strong> Review your enterprise agreements (DPA, ToS) with
                        Microsoft. Clarify terms related to data processing, access requests, breach notification
                        timelines, and audit rights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sovereign Cloud and Local Partners:</strong> Consider Microsoft’s sovereign cloud
                        offerings (e.g., the restricted cloud for Europe) if needed. Alternatively, explore partnerships
                        with fully local providers or services offering “cloud operator license” options. This can
                        reduce vendor dependency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal Consultation:</strong> Assess the risks posed by regulations like the CLOUD Act
                        and GDPR with legal experts. If necessary, develop defense strategies (court interventions,
                        compliance plans). (Note: The above are not legal advice; consult experts.)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Operational Steps:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inventory & Risk Classification (30 days):</strong> Catalog all systems, data, and data
                        flows, and classify them by sensitivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sensitive Data Location and Access Policy (60 days):</strong> Determine where critical
                        data should be stored physically/operationally. If it must remain on-prem, establish necessary
                        access control and isolation policies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coordination with Microsoft:</strong> Engage your account manager to request options
                        like Customer Key, Sovereign Cloud, or Azure Local. Seek to formalize these requests as written
                        guarantees or contract clauses.</li>
                    <li><strong>WSUS Dependency:</strong> If you rely on WSUS for update management, take this
                        deprecation into account. Plan a transition to alternatives like Microsoft Endpoint Manager /
                        System Center Configuration Manager or Azure Update Manager.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Open Source Alternatives for Data Sovereignty</h2>
                <p>Microsoft’s aggressive cloud-first strategy and the data sovereignty concerns raised by the U.S.
                    CLOUD Act have placed many organizations in a serious dilemma. Especially for organizations handling
                    sensitive data that must remain on on-premises infrastructure, Microsoft’s cloud-oriented direction
                    is causing discomfort. The deprecation of WSUS, the evolution of Active Directory toward hybrid
                    architectures, and, most importantly, Microsoft executives admitting that they must provide access
                    to data stored in Europe under U.S. laws are accelerating the search for alternative solutions.</p>

                <p>At this point, Linux desktop solutions emerge as a strong alternative, both technically and
                    strategically. Thanks to its open-source nature, Linux offers complete transparency, vendor
                    independence, and cost advantages, making it a serious option for organizations concerned about data
                    sovereignty.</p>

                <h3>Full Control: Linux’s Core Advantage</h3>
                <p>The biggest advantage of Linux desktop in enterprise environments is the full control it provides
                    over your system. The open-source codebase allows you to know exactly what is happening on your
                    system — a level of transparency not possible with closed-source systems. Concerns about hidden
                    telemetry, backdoor risks, or remote access channels are eliminated.</p>

                <p>Additionally, you can customize every component of the system to meet your organizational needs.
                    While Windows requires operating within rules set by Microsoft, on Linux, you set your own rules.
                    This freedom is particularly valuable for sectors with strict compliance requirements.</p>

                <h3>Data Sovereignty: Your Data Stays Yours</h3>
                <p>With Linux desktop, your data never leaves the organization. Contrary to Microsoft’s cloud-first
                    strategy, all data processing occurs locally. Your systems remain fully functional even without an
                    internet connection. This is an indispensable feature for critical infrastructure operators,
                    financial institutions, and government agencies.</p>

                <p>Your security team can audit the system from end to end and address vulnerabilities using their own
                    resources. Compliance with standards like GDPR and ISO 27001 becomes easier because you have
                    complete control over data flows.</p>

                <h3>Cost Advantage: Liberate Your Budget</h3>
                <p>One of the most tangible benefits of using Linux is cost savings. By completely eliminating Windows
                    and Office licenses, you can achieve significant budget relief. For organizations with hundreds or
                    thousands of desktop computers, these savings can be substantial.</p>

                <p>Linux’s ability to run efficiently on older hardware also reduces IT refresh budgets. Instead of
                    being forced into hardware upgrades by Microsoft’s requirements, you can use existing hardware
                    longer. Additionally, maintenance costs decrease thanks to the open-source support ecosystem, and
                    you avoid unexpected costs like sudden license increases or forced updates.</p>

                <h2>Which Linux Solution to Choose?</h2>
                <p>When selecting Linux for enterprise environments, it is critical to choose enterprise-ready
                    distributions. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) offers professional support and long-term guarantees.
                    For Europe-based organizations, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop is a strong alternative. Canonical’s
                    Ubuntu LTS versions provide a balance ideal for mid-sized organizations with 5-year update
                    guarantees.</p>

                <p>For cost-conscious approaches, free RHEL-compatible alternatives like CentOS Stream or AlmaLinux are
                    available. These distributions retain enterprise features while eliminating license costs.</p>

                <p>The Linux ecosystem is also mature in terms of management infrastructure. Solutions like FreeIPA and
                    Red Hat Identity Management provide full alternatives to Active Directory for identity management.
                    Tools like Ansible and Puppet enable centralized configuration management, while Fleet Commander and
                    Cockpit offer centralized policy enforcement similar to Windows Group Policy.</p>

                <p>Following Microsoft’s deprecation of WSUS, Linux offers reliable alternatives like dnf-automatic and
                    unattended-upgrades for automatic updates. These tools provide centralized management while giving
                    system administrators full control.</p>

                <h3>Application Support: Linux Is Now Ready</h3>
                <p>Advances in application support on modern Linux desktops are truly impressive. LibreOffice now offers
                    near-perfect compatibility with Microsoft Office files. Even complex Excel macros run smoothly.
                    Alternatives like OnlyOffice provide full Office compatibility without cloud integration. Collabora
                    Office, specifically developed for enterprise environments, stands out with its enterprise-focused
                    features.</p>

                <p>The situation is equally positive for business applications. Since most enterprise applications today
                    are web-based, platform independence is largely achieved. For legacy Windows applications,
                    compatibility layers like Wine and CrossOver are available. For critical applications, Windows
                    virtual machines can easily be run using VMware or VirtualBox.</p>

                <p>For developers, Linux is already an ideal platform. Professional IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Visual
                    Studio Code, and Eclipse are natively supported. Container technologies like Docker and Podman
                    perform better on Linux. Modern DevOps tools such as Git, Jenkins, and Kubernetes all run natively
                    on Linux.</p>

                <h2>Migration Strategy: A Patient, Phased Approach</h2>
                <p>When deciding to migrate to Linux, it is critical not to rush. The most successful migrations start
                    with pilot projects and proceed gradually. Begin by selecting a non-critical department to form a
                    small test group. This group can help identify technical issues and serve as pioneers for other
                    staff.</p>

                <p>Do not neglect user training. Personnel accustomed to Windows will need time to adapt to Linux and
                    LibreOffice. Prepare comprehensive training programs to ease this transition. Provide practical
                    training on basic file management, office application usage, and system updates.</p>

                <p>Attempting to change the entire system at once carries significant risks. Instead, adopt a phased
                    approach. Start with test environments, then move to support units, and finally transition
                    production environments. Keep VM solutions or dual-boot systems ready for critical Windows
                    applications.</p>

                <h2>Challenges You Might Face</h2>
                <p>Encountering some challenges during a Linux migration is normal. The biggest challenge is often
                    resistance due to user habits. Personnel who have used Windows for years may need time to adapt to
                    the new interface. This process requires patient management and continuous support.</p>

                <p>If you have industry-specific Windows-only applications, you may need to develop alternative
                    solutions. Some specialized software may not run natively on Linux. You can overcome this with Wine,
                    CrossOver, or virtual machine solutions, but some performance loss may occur.</p>

                <p>You may occasionally encounter driver support issues with legacy hardware. Older printers, scanners,
                    or specialized industrial equipment may not be fully supported on Linux. In such cases, you may need
                    to review your hardware inventory and find compatible alternatives.</p>

                <p>Exchange and Outlook integration is another challenge area. You may need to reconfigure your
                    corporate email infrastructure. Email clients like Thunderbird and Evolution support the Exchange
                    protocol, but some advanced features may not work fully.</p>

                <h2>Success Stories: Linux’s Real-World Performance</h2>
                <p>Many large organizations worldwide have successfully completed Linux desktop migrations. The City of
                    Munich’s LiMux project is perhaps one of the most famous examples. By using Linux on 15,000 desktop
                    computers, they achieved both cost savings and vendor independence. The French Gendarmerie wrote an
                    impressive success story by using Ubuntu on 37,000 computers.</p>

                <p>The Andalusia region of Spain enabled young people to become familiar with open-source technologies
                    early by using 220,000 Linux computers in the education sector. In Russia, many government agencies
                    switched to Linux due to national security concerns and gained technological independence.</p>

                <p>Examples also exist in Turkey. The TÜBİTAK-supported Pardus project developed a domestic Linux
                    distribution and conducted pilot deployments in various government agencies. Many universities
                    popularized Linux use in academic environments. Some municipalities and ministries also evaluated
                    Linux desktop through pilot projects.</p>

                <p>The common factor in these success stories is patient planning, comprehensive training, and phased
                    migration strategies. None attempted overnight transformation; all followed long-term strategies.
                </p>

                <h2>Strategic Independence: Technological Sovereignty</h2>
                <p>The benefits of using Linux desktop are not just technical; they also offer significant strategic
                    advantages. By reducing dependence on foreign software companies, you gain technological
                    sovereignty. You are unaffected by Microsoft’s policy changes, sudden price increases, or strategic
                    decisions.</p>

                <p>Free from vendor lock-in, you gain strategic flexibility. You make technology decisions based on your
                    own needs, rather than being constrained by others’ roadmaps. You also enhance local expertise,
                    building organizational knowledge by training staff in open-source technologies.</p>

                <p>Linux also offers important risk reduction advantages. In supply chain attacks, the hidden backdoor
                    risks present in closed-source systems do not exist in Linux. The risks of sudden audits and
                    penalties from vendors like Microsoft are eliminated. You avoid forced upgrades and the operational
                    risks they create.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
                <p>Microsoft’s cloud-first strategy points toward a hybrid future for corporate IT infrastructure. While
                    new features and management capabilities are largely Azure-focused, investment in classic on-prem
                    solutions is declining. This situation is forcing organizations to make new decisions, especially
                    regarding data privacy and sovereignty.</p>

                <p>Due to regulations like the CLOUD Act, merely keeping data “physically on-prem” is not sufficient for
                    security. A layered strategy is essential: customer-managed encryption keys, hybrid solutions like
                    Azure Local/Azure Stack, and contractual protections must be used together. This allows
                    organizations to benefit from the cloud’s flexibility while providing stronger assurances for
                    critical data.</p>

                <p>At the same time, Linux desktop solutions are emerging as strong contenders for organizations seeking
                    strategic independence and cost advantages. These open-source platforms offer transparency,
                    auditability, and cost control. Of course, the migration process is not easy; but with proper
                    planning, pilot projects, and phased approaches, success is achievable.</p>

                        Recommendation</p>
                    <p>If data sovereignty is a critical priority for your organization, start evaluating Linux desktop
                        options with a small pilot project. Open-source office applications and modern Linux
                        distributions have now reached a maturity level that can meet most enterprise needs.</p>

                    <p class="text-brand-400 italic">👉 In summary: A hybrid approach that leverages cloud advantages
                        without losing control, combined with open-source alternatives for strategic independence, will
                        be the two fundamental axes shaping the future of enterprises.</p>
